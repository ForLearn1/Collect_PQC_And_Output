    <title>Hybrid Schemes of NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standard Algorithms and
  Quantum Key Distribution for Key Exchange and Digital Signature</title>
    <summary>  Since the security of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms is based on
the hardness of mathematical problems, while the security of quantum key
distribution (QKD) relies on the fundamental principles of quantum physics,
each approach possesses distinct advantages and limitations that can complement
one another. Consequently, recent studies have proposed hybrid schemes that
combine QKD and PQC to establish a dual-layered security model. In response to
this trend, this study proposes hybrid schemes that integrate QKD with the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standardized PQC
algorithms. These hybrid schemes include two core components: a hybrid QKD-PQC
key exchange protocol and a hybrid QKD-PQC digital signature scheme. For the
hybrid key exchange protocol, this study combines Module-Lattice-based Key
Encapsulation Mechanisms (ML-KEM) with QKD protocols, specifically BB84 and
E91, to construct a secure key exchange protocol. In the design of the hybrid
digital signature scheme, this study utilizes Module-Lattice-based Digital
Signature Algorithms (ML-DSA) and Stateless Hash-based Digital Signature
Algorithms (SLH-DSA) to generate signature reconstruction values. These values
are verified using confirmation codes transmitted via the BB84 and E91
protocols. The proposed hybrid key exchange protocol is evaluated by examining
the shared secret key it produces, particularly with respect to entropy and
whether the output is independent and identically distributed (IID).
Furthermore, the computation time and message lengths of the proposed hybrid
schemes are evaluated.

    <title>Faster Post-Quantum TLS 1.3 Based on ML-KEM: Implementation and
  Assessment</title>
    <summary>  TLS is extensively utilized for secure data transmission over networks.
However, with the advent of quantum computers, the security of TLS based on
traditional public-key cryptography is under threat. To counter quantum
threats, it is imperative to integrate post-quantum algorithms into TLS. Most
PQ-TLS research focuses on integration and evaluation, but few studies address
the improvement of PQ-TLS performance by optimizing PQC implementation. For the
TLS protocol, handshake performance is crucial, and for post-quantum TLS
(PQ-TLS) the performance of post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs)
directly impacts handshake performance. In this work, we explore the impact of
post-quantum KEMs on PQ-TLS performance. We explore how to improve ML-KEM
performance using the latest Intel's Advanced Vector Extensions instruction set
AVX-512. We detail a spectrum of techniques devised to parallelize polynomial
multiplication, modular reduction, and other computationally intensive modules
within ML-KEM. Our optimized ML-KEM implementation achieves up to 1.64x speedup
compared to the latest AVX2 implementation. Furthermore, we introduce a novel
batch key generation method for ML-KEM that can seamlessly integrate into the
TLS protocols. The batch method accelerates the key generation procedure by
3.5x to 4.9x. We integrate the optimized AVX-512 implementation of ML-KEM into
TLS 1.3, and assess handshake performance under both PQ-only and hybrid modes.
The assessment demonstrates that our faster ML-KEM implementation results in a
higher number of TLS 1.3 handshakes per second under both modes. Additionally,
we revisit two IND-1-CCA KEM constructions discussed in Eurocrypt22 and
Asiacrypt23. Besides, we implement them based on ML-KEM and integrate the one
of better performance into TLS 1.3 with benchmarks.

    <title>Quantum-Safe Hybrid Key Exchanges with KEM-Based Authentication</title>
    <summary>  Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) between any two entities is one of the most
important security protocols available for securing our digital networks and
infrastructures. In PQCrypto 2023, Bruckner, Ramacher and Striecks proposed a
novel hybrid AKE (HAKE) protocol, dubbed Muckle+, that is particularly useful
in large quantum-safe networks consisting of a large number of nodes. Their
protocol is hybrid in the sense that it allows key material from conventional
and post-quantum primitives, as well as from quantum key distribution, to be
incorporated into a single end-to-end shared key.
  To achieve the desired authentication properties, Muckle+ utilizes
post-quantum digital signatures. However, available instantiations of such
signatures schemes are not yet efficient enough compared to their post-quantum
key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM) counterparts, particularly in large networks
with potentially several connections in a short period of time.
  To mitigate this gap, we propose Muckle# that pushes the efficiency
boundaries of currently known HAKE constructions. Muckle# uses post-quantum
key-encapsulating mechanisms for implicit authentication inspired by recent
works done in the area of Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols,
particularly, in KEMTLS (CCS'20).
  We port those ideas to the HAKE framework and develop novel proof techniques
on the way. Due to our novel KEM-based approach, the resulting protocol has a
slightly different message flow compared to prior work that we carefully align
with the HAKE framework and which makes our changes to the Muckle+ non-trivial.

    <title>A Hybrid Encryption Framework Combining Classical, Post-Quantum, and QKD
  Methods</title>
    <summary>  This paper introduces a hybrid encryption framework combining classical
cryptography (EdDSA, ECDH), post-quantum cryptography (ML-DSA-6x5, ML-KEM-768),
and Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) via Guardian to counter quantum computing
threats. Our prototype implements this integration, using a key derivation
function to generate secure symmetric and HMAC keys, and evaluates its
performance across execution time and network metrics. The approach improves
data protection by merging classical efficiency with PQC's quantum resilience
and QKD's key security, offering a practical transition path for cryptographic
systems. This research lays the foundation for future adoption of PQC in
securing digital communication.

    <title>QORE : Quantum Secure 5G/B5G Core</title>
    <summary>  Quantum computing is reshaping the security landscape of modern
telecommunications. The cryptographic foundations that secure todays 5G
systems, including RSA, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), and Diffie-Hellman
(DH), are all susceptible to attacks enabled by Shors algorithm. Protecting 5G
networks against future quantum adversaries has therefore become an urgent
engineering and research priority. In this paper we introduce QORE, a
quantum-secure 5G and Beyond 5G (B5G) Core framework that provides a clear
pathway for transitioning both the 5G Core Network Functions and User Equipment
(UE) to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). The framework uses the
NIST-standardized lattice-based algorithms Module-Lattice Key Encapsulation
Mechanism (ML-KEM) and Module-Lattice Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA) and
applies them across the 5G Service-Based Architecture (SBA). A Hybrid PQC
(HPQC) configuration is also proposed, combining classical and quantum-safe
primitives to maintain interoperability during migration. Experimental
validation shows that ML-KEM achieves quantum security with minor performance
overhead, meeting the low-latency and high-throughput requirements of
carrier-grade 5G systems. The proposed roadmap aligns with ongoing 3GPP SA3 and
SA5 study activities on the security and management of post-quantum networks as
well as with NIST PQC standardization efforts, providing practical guidance for
mitigating quantum-era risks while safeguarding long-term confidentiality and
integrity of network data.

    <title>Energy Consumption Framework and Analysis of Post-Quantum Key-Generation
  on Embedded Devices</title>
    <summary>  The emergence of quantum computing and Shor's algorithm necessitates an
imminent shift from current public key cryptography techniques to post-quantum
robust techniques. NIST has responded by standardising Post-Quantum
Cryptography (PQC) algorithms, with ML-KEM (FIPS-203) slated to replace ECDH
(Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) for key exchange. A key practical concern for
PQC adoption is energy consumption. This paper introduces a new framework for
measuring the PQC energy consumption on a Raspberry Pi when performing key
generation. The framework uses both available traditional methods and the newly
standardised ML-KEM algorithm via the commonly utilised OpenSSL library.

    <title>FIPS Compliant Quantum Secure Communication using Quantum Permutation
  Pad</title>
    <summary>  Quantum computing has entered fast development track since Shor's algorithm
was proposed in 1994. Multi-cloud services of quantum computing farms are
currently available. One of which, IBM quantum computing, presented a road map
showing their Kookaburra system with over 4158 qubits will be available in
2025. For the standardization of Post-Quantum Cryptography or PQC, the National
Institute of Standards and Technology or NIST recently announced the first
candidates for standardization with one algorithm for key encapsulation
mechanism (KEM), Kyber, and three algorithms for digital signatures. NIST has
also issued a new call for quantum-safe digital signature algorithms due June
1, 2023. This timeline shows that FIPS-certified quantum-safe TLS protocol
would take a predictably long time. However, "steal now, crack later" tactic
requires protecting data against future quantum threat actors today. NIST
recommended the use of a hybrid mode of TLS 1.3 with its extensions to support
PQC. The hybrid mode works for certain cases but FIPS certification for the
hybridized cryptomodule might still be required. This paper proposes to take a
nested mode to enable TLS 1.3 protocol with quantum-safe data, which can be
made available today and is FIPS compliant. We discussed the performance
impacts of the handshaking phase of the nested TLS 1.3 with PQC and the
symmetric encryption phase. The major impact on performance using the nested
mode is in the data symmetric encryption with AES. To overcome this performance
reduction, we suggest using quantum encryption with a quantum permutation pad
for the data encryption with a minor performance reduction of less than 10
percent.

    <title>5G-AKA-HPQC: Hybrid Post-Quantum Cryptography Protocol for
  Quantum-Resilient 5G Primary Authentication with Forward Secrecy</title>
    <summary>  5G enables digital innovation by integrating diverse services, making
security especially primary authentication crucial. Two standardized protocols,
5G AKA and EAP AKA', handle authentication for 3GPP and non 3GPP devices.
However, 5G AKA has vulnerabilities, including linkability attacks.
Additionally, quantum computing poses threats, requiring quantum resistant
cryptography. While post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is being standardized, its
real world robustness remains unproven. Conventional cryptographic schemes
offer reliability due to decades of practical use. To bridge this gap, IETF is
standardizing hybrid PQC (HPQC), combining classical and quantum resistant
methods. Ensuring forward secrecy and quantum resilience in 5G-AKA is critical.
To address these issues, we propose 5G AKA HPQC, a protocol maintaining
compatibility with existing standards while enhancing security by integrating
keys derived from Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES) and PQC
Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM). We validate its security using SVO Logic and
ProVerif, confirming its robustness. Performance evaluations assess
computational and communication overheads, demonstrating a balance between
security and efficiency. This research provides key insights into quantum-safe
authentication, contributing to future standardization of secure mobile
authentication protocols.

    <title>Post-Quantum Cryptography and Quantum-Safe Security: A Comprehensive
  Survey</title>
    <summary>  Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is moving from evaluation to deployment as
NIST finalizes standards for ML-KEM, ML-DSA, and SLH-DSA. This survey maps the
space from foundations to practice. We first develop a taxonomy across
lattice-, code-, hash-, multivariate-, isogeny-, and MPC-in-the-Head families,
summarizing security assumptions, cryptanalysis, and standardization status. We
then compare performance and communication costs using representative,
implementation-grounded measurements, and review hardware acceleration (AVX2,
FPGA/ASIC) and implementation security with a focus on side-channel resistance.
Building upward, we examine protocol integration (TLS, DNSSEC), PKI and
certificate hygiene, and deployment in constrained and high-assurance
environments (IoT, cloud, finance, blockchain). We also discuss complementarity
with quantum technologies (QKD, QRNGs) and the limits of near-term quantum
computing. Throughout, we emphasize crypto-agility, hybrid migration, and
evidence-based guidance for operators. We conclude with open problems spanning
parameter agility, leakage-resilient implementations, and domain-specific
rollout playbooks. This survey aims to be a practical reference for researchers
and practitioners planning quantum-safe systems, bridging standards,
engineering, and operations.

    <title>Analysis of Post-Quantum Cryptography in User Equipment in 5G and Beyond</title>
    <summary>  The advent of quantum computing threatens the security of classical
public-key cryptographic systems, prompting the transition to post-quantum
cryptography (PQC). While PQC has been analyzed in theory, its performance in
practical wireless communication environments remains underexplored. This paper
presents a detailed implementation and performance evaluation of NIST-selected
PQC algorithms in user equipment (UE) to UE communications over 5G networks.
Using a full 5G emulation stack (Open5GS and UERANSIM) and PQC-enabled TLS 1.3
via BoringSSL and liboqs, we examine key encapsulation mechanisms and digital
signature schemes across realistic network conditions. We evaluate performance
based on handshake latency, CPU and memory usage, bandwidth, and retransmission
rates, under varying cryptographic configurations and client loads. Our
findings show that ML-KEM with ML-DSA offers the best efficiency for
latency-sensitive applications, while SPHINCS+ and HQC combinations incur
higher computational and transmission overheads, making them unsuitable for
security-critical but time-sensitive 5G scenarios.

    <title>Hybrid Quantum Security for IPsec</title>
    <summary>  Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) offers information-theoretic security against
quantum computing threats, but integrating QKD into existing security protocols
remains an unsolved challenge due to fundamental mismatches between
pre-distributed quantum keys and computational key exchange paradigms. This
paper presents the first systematic comparison of sequential versus parallel
hybrid QKD-PQC key establishment strategies for IPsec, revealing fundamental
protocol design principles that extend beyond specific implementations. We
introduce two novel approaches for incorporating QKD into Internet Key Exchange
version 2 (IKEv2) with support for both ETSI GS QKD 004 stateful and ETSI GS
QKD 014 stateless API specifications: (1) a pure QKD approach that replaces
computational key derivation with identifier-based quantum key coordination,
and (2) a unified QKD-KEM abstraction that enables parallel composition of
quantum and post-quantum cryptographic methods within existing protocol
frameworks. Our key insight is that parallel hybrid approaches eliminate the
multiplicative latency penalties inherent in sequential methods mandated by RFC
9370, achieving significant performance improvements under realistic network
conditions. Performance evaluation using a Docker-based testing framework with
IDQuantique QKD hardware demonstrates that the parallel hybrid approach
significantly outperforms sequential methods under network latency conditions,
while pure QKD achieves minimal bandwidth overhead through identifier-based key
coordination. Our implementations provide practical quantum-enhanced IPsec
solutions suitable for critical infrastructure deployments requiring
defense-in-depth security.

    <title>Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Network Instrument: Measuring PQC
  Adoption Rates and Identifying Migration Pathways</title>
    <summary>  The problem of adopting quantum-resistant cryptographic network protocols or
post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is critically important to democratizing
quantum computing. The problem is urgent because practical quantum computers
will break classical encryption in the next few decades. Past encrypted data
has already been collected and can be decrypted in the near future. The main
challenges of adopting post-quantum cryptography lie in algorithmic complexity
and hardware/software/network implementation. The grand question of how
existing cyberinfrastructure will support post-quantum cryptography remains
unanswered.
  This paper describes: i) the design of a novel Post-Quantum Cryptography
(PQC) network instrument placed at the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a
part of the FABRIC testbed; ii) the latest results on PQC adoption rate across
a wide spectrum of network protocols (Secure Shell -- SSH, Transport Layer
Security -- TLS, etc.); iii) the current state of PQC implementation in key
scientific applications (e.g., OpenSSH or SciTokens); iv) the challenges of
being quantum-resistant; and v) discussion of potential novel attacks.
  This is the first large-scale measurement of PQC adoption at national-scale
supercomputing centers and FABRIC testbeds. Our results show that only OpenSSH
and Google Chrome have successfully implemented PQC and achieved an initial
adoption rate of 0.029% (6,044 out of 20,556,816) for OpenSSH connections at
NCSA coming from major Internet Service Providers or Autonomous Systems (ASes)
such as OARNET, GTT, Google Fiber Webpass (U.S.) and Uppsala Lans Landsting
(Sweden), with an overall increasing adoption rate year-over-year for
2023-2024. Our analyses identify pathways to migrate current applications to be
quantum-resistant.

    <title>Applied Post Quantum Cryptography: A Practical Approach for Generating
  Certificates in Industrial Environments</title>
    <summary>  The transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) presents significant
challenges for certificate-based identity management in industrial
environments, where secure onboarding of devices relies on long-lived and
interoperable credentials. This work analyzes the integration of PQC into X.509
certificate structures and compares existing tool support for classical,
hybrid, composite, and chameleon certificates. A gap is identified in available
open-source solutions, particularly for the generation and validation of hybrid
and composite certificates via command-line interfaces. To address this, a
proof-of-concept implementation based on the Bouncy Castle library is
developed. The tool supports the creation of classical, hybrid (Catalyst),
composite, and partially chameleon certificates using PQC algorithms such as
ML-DSA and SLH-DSA. It demonstrates compatibility with standard X.509 workflows
and aims to support headless operation and constrained platforms typical of
industrial systems. The implementation is modular, publicly available, and
intended to facilitate further research and testing of PQC migration strategies
in practice. A comparison with OpenSSL-based solutions highlights current
limitations in standardization, toolchain support, and algorithm coverage.

    <title>Hybrid Scheme of Post-Quantum Cryptography and Elliptic-Curve
  Cryptography for Certificates -- A Case Study of Security Credential
  Management System in Vehicle-to-Everything Communications</title>
    <summary>  Due to the current standard of Security Credential Management System (SCMS)
for Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications using asymmetric cryptography,
specifically Elliptic-Curve Cryptography (ECC), which may be vulnerable to
quantum computing attacks. Therefore, the V2X SCMS is threatened by quantum
computing attacks. However, although the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) has already selected Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)
algorithms as the standard, the current PQC algorithms may have issues such as
longer public key lengths, longer signature lengths, or lower signature
generation and verification efficiency, which may not fully meet the
requirements of V2X communication applications. In view of the challenges in
V2X communication, such as packet length, signature generation and verification
efficiency, security level, and vehicle privacy, this study proposes a hybrid
certificate scheme of PQC and ECC. By leveraging the strengths of both PQC and
ECC, this scheme aims to overcome the challenges in V2X communication. PQC is
used to establish a security level resistant to quantum computing attacks,
while ECC is utilized to establish anonymous certificates and reduce packet
length to meet the requirements of V2X communication. In the practical
experiments, the study implemented the SCMS end entity based on the Chunghwa
Telecom SCMS and the Clientron On-Board Unit (OBU) to conduct field tests in
Danhai New Town in New Taipei City. The performance of various existing hybrid
certificate schemes combining PQC (e.g., Dilithium, Falcon, and SPHINCS+) and
ECC is compared, and a practical solution is provided for V2X industries.

    <title>Evaluating Post-Quantum Cryptography on Embedded Systems: A Performance
  Analysis</title>
    <summary>  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has finalized the
selection of post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms for use in the era of
quantum computing. Despite their integration into TLS protocol for key
establishment and signature generation, there is limited study on profiling
these newly standardized algorithms in resource-constrained communication
systems. In this work, we integrate PQC into both TLS servers and clients built
upon embedded systems. Additionally, we compare the performance overhead of PQC
pairs to currently used non-PQC schemes.

    <title>Performanz Evaluation von PQC in TLS 1.3 unter variierenden
  Netzwerkcharakteristiken</title>
    <summary>  Quantum computers could break currently used asymmetric cryptographic schemes
in a few years using Shor's algorithm. They are used in numerous protocols and
applications to secure authenticity as well as key agreement, and quantum-safe
alternatives are urgently needed. NIST therefore initiated a standardization
process. This requires intensive evaluation, also with regard to performance
and integrability. Here, the integration into TLS 1.3 plays an important role,
since it is used for 90% of all Internet connections. In the present work,
algorithms for quantum-safe key exchange during TLS 1.3 handshake were
reviewed. The focus is on the influence of dedicated network parameters such as
transmission rate or packet loss in order to gain insights regarding the
suitability of the algorithms under corresponding network conditions. For the
implementation, a framework by Paquin et al. was extended to emulate network
scenarios and capture the handshake duration for selected algorithms. It is
shown that the evaluated candidates Kyber, Saber and NTRU as well as the
alternative NTRU Prime have a very good overall performance and partly undercut
the handshake duration of the classical ECDH. The choice of a higher security
level or hybrid variants does not make a significant difference here. This is
not the case with alternatives such as FrodoKEM, SIKE, HQC or BIKE, which have
individual disadvantages and whose respective performance varies greatly
depending on the security level and hybrid implementation. This is especially
true for the data-intensive algorithm FrodoKEM. In general, the prevailing
network characteristics should be taken into account when choosing scheme and
variant. Further it becomes clear that the performance of the handshake is
influenced by external factors such as TCP mechanisms or MTU, which could
compensate for possible disadvantages due to PQC if configured appropriately.

    <title>The Security Performance Analysis of Blockchain System Based on
  Post-Quantum Cryptography -- A Case Study of Cryptocurrency Exchanges</title>
    <summary>  The current blockchain system for cryptocurrency exchanges primarily employs
elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) for generating key pairs in wallets, and
elliptic curve digital signature algorithms (ECDSA) for generating signatures
in transactions. Consequently, with the maturation of quantum computing
technology, the current blockchain system faces the risk of quantum computing
attacks. Quantum computers may potentially counterfeit signatures produced by
ECDSA. Therefore, this study analyzes the vulnerabilities of the current
blockchain system to quantum computing attacks and proposes a post-quantum
cryptography (PQC)-based blockchain system to enhance security by addressing
and improving each identified weakness. Furthermore, this study proposes
PQC-based wallets and PQC-based transactions, utilizing PQC digital signature
algorithms to generate PQC-based signatures for the inputs in PQC-based
transactions, thereby preventing signatures from being counterfeited by quantum
computing. Experimental results demonstrate that the efficiency of the
Dilithium algorithm, a PQC digital signature algorithm, in producing wallets,
generating signatures, and verifying signatures surpasses that of ECDSA in the
current blockchain system. Furthermore, the Dilithium algorithm also exhibits a
higher security level.

    <title>Ciphertext Malleability in Lattice-Based KEMs as a Countermeasure to
  Side Channel Analysis</title>
    <summary>  Due to developments in quantum computing, classical asymmetric cryptography
is at risk of being breached. Consequently, new Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)
primitives using lattices are studied. Another point of scrutiny is the
resilience of these new primitives to Side Channel Analysis (SCA), where an
attacker can study physical leakages. In this work we discuss a SCA
vulnerability due to the ciphertext malleability of some PQC primitives exposed
by a work from Ravi et al. We propose a novel countermeasure to this
vulnerability exploiting the same ciphertext malleability and discuss its
practical application to several PQC primitives. We also extend the seminal
work of Ravi et al. by detailing their attack on the different security levels
of a post-quantum Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM), namely FrodoKEM. We also
provide a generalisation of their attack to different parameters which could be
used in future similar primitives.

    <title>Migrating Software Systems towards Post-Quantum-Cryptography -- A
  Systematic Literature Review</title>
    <summary>  Networks such as the Internet are essential for our connected world. Quantum
computing poses a threat to this heterogeneous infrastructure since it
threatens fundamental security mechanisms. Therefore, a migration to
post-quantum-cryptography (PQC) is necessary for networks and their components.
At the moment, there is little knowledge on how such migrations should be
structured and implemented in practice. Our systematic literature review
addresses migration approaches for IP networks towards PQC. It surveys papers
about the migration process and exemplary real-world software system
migrations. On the process side, we found that terminology, migration steps,
and roles are not defined precisely or consistently across the literature.
Still, we identified four major phases and appropriate substeps which we
matched with also emerging archetypes of roles. In terms of real-world
migrations, we see that reports used several different PQC implementations and
hybrid solutions for migrations of systems belonging to a wide range of system
types. Across all papers we noticed three major challenges for adopters:
missing experience of PQC and a high realization effort, concerns about the
security of the upcoming system, and finally, high complexity. Our findings
indicate that recent standardization efforts already push quantum-safe
networking forward. However, the literature is still not in consensus about
definitions and best practices. Implementations are mostly experimental and not
necessarily practical, leading to an overall chaotic situation. To better grasp
this fast moving field of (applied) research, our systematic literature review
provides a comprehensive overview of its current state and serves as a starting
point for delving into the matter of PQC migration.

    <title>Practical hybrid PQC-QKD protocols with enhanced security and
  performance</title>
    <summary>  Quantum resistance is vital for emerging cryptographic systems as quantum
technologies continue to advance towards large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum
computers. Resistance may be offered by quantum key distribution (QKD), which
provides information-theoretic security using quantum states of photons, but
may be limited by transmission loss at long distances. An alternative approach
uses classical means and is conjectured to be resistant to quantum attacks,
so-called post-quantum cryptography (PQC), but it is yet to be rigorously
proven, and its current implementations are computationally expensive. To
overcome the security and performance challenges present in each, here we
develop hybrid protocols by which QKD and PQC inter-operate within a joint
quantum-classical network. In particular, we consider different hybrid designs
that may offer enhanced speed and/or security over the individual performance
of either approach. Furthermore, we present a method for analyzing the security
of hybrid protocols in key distribution networks. Our hybrid approach paves the
way for joint quantum-classical communication networks, which leverage the
advantages of both QKD and PQC and can be tailored to the requirements of
various practical networks.

    <title>NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standard Algorithms Based on Quantum
  Random Number Generators</title>
    <summary>  In recent years, the advancement of quantum computing technology has posed
potential security threats to RSA cryptography and elliptic curve cryptography.
In response, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
published several Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) of
post-quantum cryptography (PQC) in August 2024, including the
Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM), Module-Lattice-Based
Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA), and Stateless Hash-Based Digital
Signature Algorithm (SLH-DSA). Although these PQC algorithms are designed to
resist quantum computing attacks, they may not provide adequate security in
certain specialized application scenarios. To address this issue, this study
proposes quantum random number generator (QRNG)-based PQC algorithms. These
algorithms leverage quantum computing to generate random numbers, which serve
as the foundation for key pair generation, key encapsulation, and digital
signature generation. A generalized architecture of QRNG is proposed, along
with the design of six QRNGs. Each generator is evaluated according to the
statistical validation procedures outlined in NIST SP 800-90B, including tests
for verification of entropy sources and independent and identically distributed
(IID) outputs. Experimental results assess the computation time of the six
QRNGs, as well as the performance of QRNG-based ML-KEM, QRNG-based ML-DSA, and
QRNG-based SLH-DSA. These findings provide valuable reference data for future
deployment of PQC systems.

    <title>QKD-KEM: Hybrid QKD Integration into TLS with OpenSSL Providers</title>
    <summary>  Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) promises information-theoretic security, yet
integrating QKD into existing protocols like TLS remains challenging due to its
fundamentally different operational model. In this paper, we propose a hybrid
QKD-KEM protocol with two distinct integration approaches: a client-initiated
flow compatible with both ETSI 004 and 014 specifications, and a
server-initiated flow similar to existing work but limited to stateless ETSI
014 APIs. Unlike previous implementations, our work specifically addresses the
integration of stateful QKD key exchange protocols (ETSI 004) which is
essential for production QKD networks but has remained largely unexplored. By
adapting OpenSSL's provider infrastructure to accommodate QKD's pre-distributed
key model, we maintain compatibility with current TLS implementations while
offering dual layers of security. Performance evaluations demonstrate the
feasibility of our hybrid scheme with acceptable overhead, showing that robust
security against quantum threats is achievable while addressing the unique
requirements of different QKD API specifications.

    <title>Identifying Research Challenges in Post Quantum Cryptography Migration
  and Cryptographic Agility</title>
    <summary>  The implications of sufficiently large quantum computers for widely used
public-key cryptography is well-documented and increasingly discussed by the
security community. An April 2016 report by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST), notably, calls out the need for new standards to replace
cryptosystems based on integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems,
which have been shown to be vulnerable to Shor's quantum algorithm for prime
factorization. Specifically, widely used RSA, ECDSA, ECDH, and DSA
cryptosystems will need to be replaced by post-quantum cryptography (PQC)
alternatives (also known as quantum-resistant or quantum-safe cryptography).
Failure to transition before sufficiently powerful quantum computers are
realized will jeopardize the security of public key cryptosystems which are
widely deployed within communication protocols, digital signing mechanisms,
authentication frameworks, and more. To avoid this, NIST has actively led a PQC
standardization effort since 2016, leveraging a large and international
research community.
  On January 31-February 1, 2019, the Computing Community Consortium (CCC) held
a workshop in Washington, D.C. to discuss research challenges associated with
PQC migration. Entitled, "Identifying Research Challenges in Post Quantum
Cryptography Migration and Cryptographic Agility", participants came from three
distinct yet related communities: cryptographers contributing to the NIST PQC
standards effort, applied cryptographers with expertise in creating
cryptographic solutions and implementing cryptography in real-world settings,
and industry practitioners with expertise in deploying cryptographic standards
within products and compute infrastructures. Discussion centered around two key
themes: identifying constituent challenges in PQC migration and imagining a new
science of "cryptographic agility".

    <title>Rudraksh: A compact and lightweight post-quantum key-encapsulation
  mechanism</title>
    <summary>  Resource-constrained devices such as wireless sensors and Internet of Things
(IoT) devices have become ubiquitous in our digital ecosystem. These devices
generate and handle a major part of our digital data. However, due to the
impending threat of quantum computers on our existing public-key cryptographic
schemes and the limited resources available on IoT devices, it is important to
design lightweight post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) schemes suitable for these
devices. In this work, we explored the design space of learning with
error-based PQC schemes to design a lightweight key-encapsulation mechanism
(KEM) suitable for resource-constrained devices. We have done a scrupulous and
extensive analysis and evaluation of different design elements, such as
polynomial size, field modulus structure, reduction algorithm, and secret and
error distribution of an LWE-based KEM. Our explorations led to the proposal of
a lightweight PQC-KEM, Rudraksh, without compromising security. Our scheme
provides security against chosen ciphertext attacks (CCA) with more than 100
bits of Core-SVP post-quantum security and belongs to the NIST-level-I security
category (provide security at least as much as AES-128). We have also shown how
ASCON can be used for lightweight pseudo-random number generation and hash
function in the lattice-based KEMs instead of the widely used Keccak for
lightweight design. Our FPGA results show that Rudraksh currently requires the
least area among the PQC KEMs of similar security. Our implementation of
Rudraksh provides a $\sim3\times$ improvement in terms of the area requirement
compared to the state-of-the-art area-optimized implementation of Kyber, can
operate at $63\%$-$76\%$ higher frequency with respect to high-throughput
Kyber, and improves time-area-product $\sim2\times$ compared to the
state-of-the-art compact implementation of Kyber published in HPEC 2022.

    <title>OSKR/OKAI: Systematic Optimization of Key Encapsulation Mechanisms from
  Module Lattice</title>
    <summary>  In this work, we make \emph{systematic} optimizations of key encapsulation
mechanisms (KEM) based on module learning-with-errors (MLWE), covering
algorithmic design, fundamental operation of number-theoretic transform (NTT),
approaches to expanding encapsulated key size, and optimized implementation
coding. We focus on Kyber (now in the Round-3 finalist of NIST PQC
standardization) and Aigis (a variant of Kyber proposed at PKC 2020).
  By careful analysis, we first observe that the algorithmic design of Kyber
and Aigis can be optimized by the mechanism of asymmetric key consensus with
noise (AKCN) proposed in \cite{JZ16,JZ19}. Specifically, the decryption process
can be simplified with AKCN, leading to a both faster and less error-prone
decryption process. Moreover, the AKCN-based optimized version has perfect
compatibility with the deployment of Kyber/Aigis in reality, as they can run on
the same parameters, the same public key, and the same encryption process.
  We make a systematic study of the variants of NTT proposed in recent years
for extending its applicability scope, make concrete analysis of their exact
computational complexity, and in particular show their equivalence. We then
present a new variant named hybrid-NTT (H-NTT), combining the advantages of
existing NTT methods, and derive its optimality in computational complexity.
The H-NTT technique not only has larger applicability scope but also allows for
modular and unified implementation codes of NTT operations even with varying
module dimensions.
  We analyze and compare the different approaches to expand the size of key to
be encapsulated (specifically, 512-bit key for dimension of 1024), and conclude
with the most economic approach. To mitigate the compatibility issue in
implementations we adopt the proposed H-NTT method.

    <title>QFFN-BERT: An Empirical Study of Depth, Performance, and Data Efficiency
  in Hybrid Quantum-Classical Transformers</title>
    <summary>  Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have recently emerged as promising
components for enhancing the expressibility of neural architectures. In this
work, we introduce QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical transformer where the
feedforward network (FFN) modules of a compact BERT variant are replaced by
PQC-based layers. This design is motivated by the dominant parameter
contribution of FFNs, which account for approximately two-thirds of the
parameters within standard Transformer encoder blocks. While prior studies have
primarily integrated PQCs into self-attention modules, our work focuses on the
FFN and systematically investigates the trade-offs between PQC depth,
expressibility, and trainability. Our final PQC architecture incorporates a
residual connection, both $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and an alternating
entanglement strategy to ensure stable training and high expressibility. Our
experiments, conducted on a classical simulator, on the SST-2 and DBpedia
benchmarks demonstrate two key findings. First, a carefully configured
QFFN-BERT achieves up to 102.0% of the baseline accuracy, surpassing its
classical counterpart in a full-data setting while reducing FFN-specific
parameters by over 99%. Second, our model exhibits a consistent and competitive
edge in few-shot learning scenarios, confirming its potential for superior data
efficiency. These results, supported by an ablation study on a non-optimized
PQC that failed to learn, confirm that PQCs can serve as powerful and
parameter-efficient alternatives to classical FFNs when co-designed with
foundational deep learning principles.

    <title>Future-Proofing Cloud Security Against Quantum Attacks: Risk,
  Transition, and Mitigation Strategies</title>
    <summary>  Quantum Computing (QC) introduces a transformative threat to digital
security, with the potential to compromise widely deployed classical
cryptographic systems. This survey offers a comprehensive and systematic
examination of quantumsafe security for Cloud Computing (CC), focusing on the
vulnerabilities, transition strategies, and mitigation mechanisms required to
secure cloud infrastructures in the quantum era. We evaluated the landscape of
quantum threats across the entire CC stack, demonstrating how quantum
algorithms can undermine classical encryption and compromise cloud security at
multiple architectural layers. Using a structured risk assessment methodology
based on the STRIDE model, we evaluate quantum-induced attack vectors and their
impact on cloud environments. To address these challenges, we propose a layered
security framework that integrates hybrid cryptographic transition strategies,
cryptographic agility, and proactive risk mitigation. We analyze the
preparation and implementation approaches of the major Cloud Service Providers
(CSPs), including AWS, Azure and GCP, synthesizing platform-specific
initiatives toward Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). Furthermore, we provide a
detailed evaluation of standardized PQC algorithms, exploring their resilience
to side-channel and active attacks within cloud-native deployments. This survey
serves as a strategic reference for cloud architects, policymakers, and
researchers, offering actionable insights for navigating the complex transition
to quantum-resilient cloud systems. We conclude by identifying six key future
research directions: standardization and interoperability, performance and
scalability, implementation security, integration with emerging technologies,
systemic preparedness, and crypto-agile migration frameworks.

    <title>Performance Analysis of TLS for Quantum Robust Cryptography on a
  Constrained Device</title>
    <summary>  Advances in quantum computing make Shor's algorithm for factorising numbers
ever more tractable. This threatens the security of any cryptographic system
which often relies on the difficulty of factorisation. It also threatens
methods based on discrete logarithms, such as with the Diffie-Hellman key
exchange method. For a cryptographic system to remain secure against a quantum
adversary, we need to build methods based on a hard mathematical problem, which
are not susceptible to Shor's algorithm and which create Post Quantum
Cryptography (PQC). While high-powered computing devices may be able to run
these new methods, we need to investigate how well these methods run on limited
powered devices. This paper outlines an evaluation framework for PQC within
constrained devices, and contributes to the area by providing benchmarks of the
front-running algorithms on a popular single-board low-power device.

    <title>Performance Analysis and Deployment Considerations of Post-Quantum
  Cryptography for Consumer Electronics</title>
    <summary>  Quantum computing threatens the security foundations of consumer electronics
(CE). Preparing the diverse CE ecosystem, particularly resource-constrained
devices, for the post-quantum era requires quantitative understanding of
quantum-resistant cryptography (PQC) performance. This paper presents a
comprehensive cross-platform performance analysis of leading PQC Key
Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) and digital signatures (NIST
standards/candidates) compared against classical RSA/ECC. We evaluated
execution time, communication costs (key/signature sizes), and memory footprint
indicators on high-performance (macOS/M4, Ubuntu/x86) and constrained platforms
(Raspberry Pi 4/ARM). Our quantitative results reveal lattice-based schemes,
notably NIST standards ML-KEM (Kyber) and ML-DSA (Dilithium), provide a strong
balance of computational efficiency and moderate communication/storage
overhead, making them highly suitable for many CE applications. In contrast,
code-based Classic McEliece imposes significant key size challenges, while
hash-based SPHINCS+ offers high security assurance but demands large signature
sizes impacting bandwidth and storage. Based on empirical data across platforms
and security levels, we provide specific deployment recommendations tailored to
different CE scenarios (e.g., wearables, smart home hubs, mobile devices),
offering guidance for manufacturers navigating the PQC transition.

    <title>Post-Quantum Cryptography for Internet of Things: A Survey on
  Performance and Optimization</title>
    <summary>  Due to recent development in quantum computing, the invention of a large
quantum computer is no longer a distant future. Quantum computing severely
threatens modern cryptography, as the hard mathematical problems beneath
classic public-key cryptosystems can be solved easily by a sufficiently large
quantum computer. As such, researchers have proposed PQC based on problems that
even quantum computers cannot efficiently solve. Generally, post-quantum
encryption and signatures can be hard to compute. This could potentially be a
problem for IoT, which usually consist lightweight devices with limited
computational power. In this paper, we survey existing literature on the
performance for PQC in resource-constrained devices to understand the
severeness of this problem. We also review recent proposals to optimize PQC
algorithms for resource-constrained devices. Overall, we find that whilst PQC
may be feasible for reasonably lightweight IoT, proposals for their
optimization seem to lack standardization. As such, we suggest future research
to seek coordination, in order to ensure an efficient and safe migration toward
IoT for the post-quantum era.

    <title>Error Detection Schemes for Barrett Reduction of CT-BU on FPGA in Post
  Quantum Cryptography</title>
    <summary>  A fault can occur naturally or intentionally. However, intentionally
injecting faults into hardware accelerators of Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC)
algorithms may leak sensitive information. This intentional fault injection in
side-channel attacks compromises the reliability of PQC implementations. The
recently NIST-standardized key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), Kyber may also
leak information at the hardware implementation level. This work proposes three
efficient and lightweight recomputation-based fault detection methods for
Barrett Reduction in the Cooley-Tukey Butterfly Unit (CT-BU) of Kyber on a
Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The CT-BU and Barrett Reduction are
fundamental components in structured lattice-based PQC algorithms, including
Kyber, NTRU, Falcon, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, etc. This paper introduces a new
algorithm, Recomputation with Swapped Operand (RESWO), for fault detection.
While Recomputation with Negated Operand (RENO) and Recomputation with Shifted
Operand (RESO) are existing methods used in other PQC hardware algorithms. To
the best of our knowledge, RENO and RESO have never been used in Barrett
Reduction before. The proposed RESWO method consumes a similar number of slices
compared to RENO and RESO. However, RESWO shows lesser delay compared to both
RENO and RESO. The fault detection efficiency of RESWO, RENO, and RESO is
nearly 100%.

    <title>An Efficient Hybrid Key Exchange Mechanism</title>
    <summary>  We present \textsc{CHOKE}, a novel code-based hybrid key-encapsulation
mechanism (KEM) designed to securely and efficiently transmit multiple session
keys simultaneously. By encoding $n$ independent session keys with an
individually secure linear code and encapsulating each resulting coded symbol
using a separate KEM, \textsc{CHOKE} achieves computational individual security
-- each key remains secure as long as at least one underlying KEM remains
unbroken. Compared to traditional serial or combiner-based hybrid schemes,
\textsc{CHOKE} reduces computational and communication costs by an $n$-fold
factor. Furthermore, we show that the communication cost of our construction is
optimal under the requirement that each KEM must be used at least once.

    <title>QKD Entity Source Authentication: Defense-in-Depth for Post Quantum
  Cryptography</title>
    <summary>  Quantum key distribution (QKD) was conceived by Charles Bennett and Gilles
Brassard in December of 1984. In the ensuing 39 years QKD systems have been
deployed around the world to provide secure encryption for terrestrial as well
as satellite communication. In 2016 the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) began a program to standardize a series of quantum resistant
algorithms to replace our current encryption standards thereby protecting
against future quantum computers breaking public key cryptography. This program
is known as post quantum cryptography or PQC. One of the tenets of
cybersecurity is to use an approach that simultaneously provides multiple
protections known as defense-in-depth. This approach seeks to avoid single
points of failure. The goal of this paper is to examine the suitability of a
hybrid QKD / PQC defense-in-depth strategy. A focus of the paper will be to
examine the sufficiency of initial QKD hardware authentication (entity source
authentication) which is necessary to guard against man-in-the-middle attacks.

    <title>Experimental Authentication of Quantum Key Distribution with
  Post-quantum Cryptography</title>
    <summary>  Quantum key distribution (QKD) can provide information theoretically secure
key exchange even in the era of quantum computer. However, QKD requires the
classical channel to be authenticated, and the current method is pre-sharing
symmetric keys. For a QKD network of $n$ users, this method requires $C_n^2 =
n(n-1)/2$ pairs of symmetric keys to realize pairwise interconnection. In
contrast, with the help of mature public key infrastructure (PKI) and
post-quantum cryptography (PQC) with quantum resistant security, each user only
needs to apply for a digital certificate from certificate authority (CA) to
achieve efficient and secure authentication for QKD. We only need to assume the
short-term security of the PQC algorithm to achieve the long-term security of
the distributed keys. Here, we experimentally verified the feasibility,
efficiency and stability of the PQC algorithm in QKD authentication, and
demonstrated the advantages when new users join the QKD network. Using PQC
authentication we only need to believe the CA is safe, rather than all trusted
relays. QKD combined with PQC authentication will greatly promote and extend
the application prospects of quantum safe communication.

    <title>Integration of quantum random number generators with post-quantum
  cryptography algorithms</title>
    <summary>  As quantum technologies advance, the security of popular cryptographic
protocols becomes more threatened by the capabilities of Cryptographically
Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs). In this scenario, Post-Quantum Cryptography
(PQC) has become a potential solution to prolong the life of existing Public
Key Infrastructure (PKI) systems. However, PQC protocols depend on high-quality
randomness for key generation and encapsulation procedures, with the quality of
the entropy source potentially having a profound impact on the security of the
overall system. In this work, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept enabling the
incorporation of Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG) devices within
communication networks using PQC-based Transport Layer Security (TLS).Using
open-source cryptographic libraries and commercial QRNG hardware, we
demonstrate their use as entropy sources via an Entropy-as-a-Service (EaaS)
model. We highlight two particular use cases: a fully virtualized private PKI
network and a connection to an external PQC-enabled server. Experimental
results show that EaaS QRNG enables real-time entropy monitoring and quality
assessment in cryptographic management systems, with negligible impact on TLS
handshake time.

    <title>Evaluating Post-Quantum Cryptographic Algorithms on Resource-Constrained
  Devices</title>
    <summary>  The rapid advancement of quantum computing poses a critical threat to
classical cryptographic algorithms such as RSA and ECC, particularly in
Internet of Things (IoT) devices, where secure communication is essential but
often constrained by limited computational resources. This paper investigates
the feasibility of deploying post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms on
resource-constrained devices. In particular, we implement three PQC algorithms
-- BIKE, CRYSTALS-Kyber, and HQC -- on a lightweight IoT platform built with
Raspberry Pi devices. Leveraging the Open Quantum Safe (\texttt{liboqs})
library in conjunction with \texttt{mbedTLS}, we develop quantum-secure key
exchange protocols, and evaluate their performance in terms of computational
overhead, memory usage, and energy consumption for quantum secure
communication. Experimental results demonstrate that the integration of PQC
algorithms on constrained hardware is practical, reinforcing the urgent need
for quantum-resilient cryptographic frameworks in next-generation IoT devices.

    <title>Quantum-Resistant Domain Name System: A Comprehensive System-Level Study</title>
    <summary>  The Domain Name System (DNS) plays a foundational role in Internet
infrastructure, yet its core protocols remain vulnerable to compromise by
quantum adversaries. As cryptographically relevant quantum computers become a
realistic threat, ensuring DNS confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity in
the post-quantum era is imperative. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
system-level study of post-quantum DNS security across three widely deployed
mechanisms: DNSSEC, DNS-over-TLS (DoT), and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH). We propose
Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC)-DNS, a unified framework for benchmarking DNS
security under legacy, post-quantum, and hybrid cryptographic configurations.
Our implementation leverages the Open Quantum Safe (OQS) libraries and
integrates lattice- and hash-based primitives into BIND9 and TLS 1.3 stacks. We
formalize performance and threat models and analyze the impact of post-quantum
key encapsulation and digital signatures on end-to-end DNS resolution.
Experimental results on a containerized testbed reveal that lattice-based
primitives such as Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (MLKEM) and
Falcon offer practical latency and resource profiles, while hash-based schemes
like SPHINCS+ significantly increase message sizes and processing overhead. We
also examine security implications including downgrade risks, fragmentation
vulnerabilities, and susceptibility to denial-of-service amplification. Our
findings inform practical guidance for deploying quantum-resilient DNS and
contribute to the broader effort of securing core Internet protocols for the
post-quantum future.

    <title>Performance Analysis and Industry Deployment of Post-Quantum
  Cryptography Algorithms</title>
    <summary>  As quantum computing advances, modern cryptographic standards face an
existential threat, necessitating a transition to post-quantum cryptography
(PQC). The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has selected
CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium as standardized PQC algorithms for secure
key exchange and digital signatures, respectively. This study conducts a
comprehensive performance analysis of these algorithms by benchmarking
execution times across cryptographic operations such as key generation,
encapsulation, decapsulation, signing, and verification. Additionally, the
impact of AVX2 optimizations is evaluated to assess hardware acceleration
benefits. Our findings demonstrate that Kyber and Dilithium achieve efficient
execution times, outperforming classical cryptographic schemes such as RSA and
ECDSA at equivalent security levels. Beyond technical performance, the
real-world deployment of PQC introduces challenges in telecommunications
networks, where large-scale infrastructure upgrades, interoperability with
legacy systems, and regulatory constraints must be addressed. This paper
examines the feasibility of PQC adoption in telecom environments, highlighting
key transition challenges, security risks, and implementation strategies.
Through industry case studies, we illustrate how telecom operators are
integrating PQC into 5G authentication, subscriber identity protection, and
secure communications. Our analysis provides insights into the computational
trade-offs, deployment considerations, and standardization efforts shaping the
future of quantum-safe cryptographic infrastructure.

    <title>Are Enterprises Ready for Quantum-Safe Cybersecurity?</title>
    <summary>  Quantum computing threatens to undermine classical cryptography by breaking
widely deployed encryption and signature schemes. This paper examines
enterprise readiness for quantum-safe cybersecurity through three perspectives:
(i) the technologist view, assessing the maturity of post-quantum cryptography
(PQC) and quantum key distribution (QKD); (ii) the enterprise (CISO/CIO) view,
analyzing organizational awareness, risk management, and operational barriers;
and (iii) the threat actor view, evaluating the evolving quantum threat and the
urgency of migration. Using recent standards (e.g., NIST's 2024 PQC
algorithms), industry surveys, and threat intelligence, we synthesize findings
via a SWOT analysis to map strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
Results indicate uneven and generally insufficient preparedness: while PQC
standards and niche QKD deployments signal technical progress, fewer than 5\%
of enterprises have formal quantum-transition plans, and many underestimate
"harvest now, decrypt later" risks. Financial, telecom, and government sectors
have begun migration, but most industries remain exploratory or stalled by
costs, complexity, and skills gaps. Expert consensus places cryptanalytically
relevant quantum computers in the 2030s, yet delayed preparation could leave
today's data vulnerable for decades. We recommend immediate steps: establishing
crypto-agility, creating quantum transition roadmaps, prioritizing PQC
deployment in high-value systems, and upskilling cybersecurity teams. A
coordinated, proactive approach is essential to secure current and future
digital assets in the quantum era.

    <title>Quantum-Resistant Cryptography</title>
    <summary>  Quantum-resistant cryptography is cryptography that aims to deliver
cryptographic functions and protocols that remain secure even if large-scale
fault-tolerant quantum computers are built. NIST will soon announce the first
selected public-key cryptography algorithms in its Post-Quantum Cryptography
(PQC) standardization which is the most important current effort in the field
of quantum-resistant cryptography. This report provides an overview to security
experts who do not yet have a deep understanding of quantum-resistant
cryptography. It surveys the computational model of quantum computers; the
quantum algorithms that affect cryptography the most; the risk of
Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs) being built; the security
of symmetric and public-key cryptography in the presence of CRQCs; the NIST PQC
standardization effort; the migration to quantum-resistant public-key
cryptography; the relevance of Quantum Key Distribution as a complement to
conventional cryptography; and the relevance of Quantum Random Number
Generators as a complement to current hardware Random Number Generators.

    <title>Evolutionary Quantum Architecture Search for Parametrized Quantum
  Circuits</title>
    <summary>  Recent advancements in quantum computing have shown promising computational
advantages in many problem areas. As one of those areas with increasing
attention, hybrid quantum-classical machine learning systems have demonstrated
the capability to solve various data-driven learning tasks. Recent works show
that parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) can be used to solve challenging
reinforcement learning (RL) tasks with provable learning advantages. While
existing works yield potentials of PQC-based methods, the design choices of PQC
architectures and their influences on the learning tasks are generally
underexplored. In this work, we introduce EQAS-PQC, an evolutionary quantum
architecture search framework for PQC-based models, which uses a
population-based genetic algorithm to evolve PQC architectures by exploring the
search space of quantum operations. Experimental results show that our method
can significantly improve the performance of hybrid quantum-classical models in
solving benchmark reinforcement problems. We also model the probability
distributions of quantum operations in top-performing architectures to identify
essential design choices that are critical to the performance.

    <title>Enhancing Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems Security: A Shift to
  Post-Quantum Cryptography</title>
    <summary>  The rise of quantum computing threatens traditional cryptographic algorithms
that secure Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems (TCPS). Shor's algorithm
poses a significant threat to RSA and ECC, while Grover's algorithm reduces the
security of symmetric encryption schemes, such as AES. The objective of this
paper is to underscore the urgency of transitioning to post-quantum
cryptography (PQC) to mitigate these risks in TCPS by analyzing the
vulnerabilities of traditional cryptographic schemes and the applicability of
standardized PQC schemes in TCPS. We analyzed vulnerabilities in traditional
cryptography against quantum attacks and reviewed the applicability of
NIST-standardized PQC schemes, including CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium,
and SPHINCS+, in TCPS. We conducted a case study to analyze the vulnerabilities
of a TCPS application from the Architecture Reference for Cooperative and
Intelligent Transportation (ARC-IT) service package, i.e., Electronic Toll
Collection, leveraging the Microsoft Threat Modeling tool. This case study
highlights the cryptographic vulnerabilities of a TCPS application and presents
how PQC can effectively counter these threats. Additionally, we evaluated
CRYSTALS-Kyber's performance across wired and wireless TCPS data communication
scenarios. While CRYSTALS-Kyber proves effective in securing TCPS applications
over high-bandwidth, low-latency Ethernet networks, our analysis highlights
challenges in meeting the stringent latency requirements of safety-critical
wireless applications within TCPS. Future research should focus on developing
lightweight PQC solutions and hybrid schemes that integrate traditional and PQC
algorithms, to enhance compatibility, scalability, and real-time performance,
ensuring robust protection against emerging quantum threats in TCPS.

    <title>Quantum-Safe integration of TLS in SDN networks</title>
    <summary>  Shor's algorithm efficiently solves factoring and discrete logarithm problems
using quantum computers, compromising all public key schemes used today. These
schemes rely on assumptions on their computational complexity, which quantum
computers can easily bypass. The solutions have to come from new algorithms -
called Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) - or from new methods, such as Quantum
Key Distribution (QKD). The former replicate the computational security ideas
of classical public key algorithms, while the latter recurs to use the quantum
properties of nature, which also brings a mathematical security proof,
potentially offering Information-Theoretic Security. To secure data in the
future, we must adopt these paradigms. With the speed of quantum computing
advancements, the transition to quantum-safe cryptography within the next
decade is critical. Delays could expose long-lived confidential data, as
current encryption may be broken before its value expires. However, the shift
must balance the adoption of new technologies with maintaining proven systems
to protect against present and future threats. In this work, we have selected
Transport Layer Security, one of the most widely used protocols, as the
foundation to hybridize classical, quantum, and post-quantum cryptography in a
way suitable for broad adoption in Software-Defined Networking, the most
flexible networking paradigm that has been used to deploy integrated
quantum-classical networks. To this end, we use standards for QKD key
extraction and SDN integration. The purposed implementation is based on the
latest version of TLS and demonstrates advanced capabilities such as rekeying
and key transport across a large QKD network, while supporting crypto-agility
and maintaining backward compatibility through the use of ciphersuites. The
performance of this approach has been demonstrated using a deployed production
infrastructure.

    <title>Performance Analysis and Evaluation of Post Quantum Secure Blockchained
  Federated Learning</title>
    <summary>  Post-quantum security is critical in the quantum era. Quantum computers,
along with quantum algorithms, make the standard cryptography based on RSA or
ECDSA over FL or Blockchain vulnerable. The implementation of post-quantum
cryptography (PQC) over such systems is poorly understood as PQC is still in
its standardization phase. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach to employ
PQC over blockchain-based FL (BFL), where we combine a stateless signature
scheme like Dilithium (or Falcon) with a stateful hash-based signature scheme
like the extended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS). We propose a linear-based
formulaic approach to device role selection mechanisms based on multiple
factors to address the performance aspect. Our holistic approach of utilizing a
verifiable random function (VRF) to assist in the blockchain consensus
mechanism shows the practicality of the proposed approaches. The proposed
method and extensive experimental results contribute to enhancing the security
and performance aspects of BFL systems.

    <title>Authentication of Metropolitan Quantum Key Distribution Network with
  Post-quantum Cryptography</title>
    <summary>  Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides information theoretically secures key
exchange requiring authentication of the classic data processing channel via
pre-sharing of symmetric private keys. In previous studies, the lattice-based
post-quantum digital signature algorithm Aigis-Sig, combined with public-key
infrastructure (PKI) was used to achieve high-efficiency quantum security
authentication of QKD, and its advantages in simplifying the MAN network
structure and new user entry were demonstrated. This experiment further
integrates the PQC algorithm into the commercial QKD system, the Jinan field
metropolitan QKD network comprised of 14 user nodes and 5 optical switching
nodes. The feasibility, effectiveness and stability of the post-quantum
cryptography (PQC) algorithm and advantages of replacing trusted relays with
optical switching brought by PQC authentication large-scale metropolitan area
QKD network were verified. QKD with PQC authentication has potential in
quantum-secure communications, specifically in metropolitan QKD networks.

    <title>Techno-Economic Feasibility Analysis of Quantum Key Distribution for
  Power-System Communications</title>
    <summary>  The accelerating digitalization and decentralization of modern power systems
expose critical communication infrastructures to escalating cyber risks,
particularly under emerging quantum computing threats. This paper presents an
integrated techno-economic framework to evaluate the feasibility of Quantum Key
Distribution (QKD) for secure power-system communications. A stochastic system
model is developed to jointly capture time-varying key demand, QKD supply under
optical-loss constraints, station-side buffering, and post-quantum cryptography
(PQC) fallback mechanisms. Analytical conditions are derived for service-level
assurance, including buffer stability, outage probability, and availability
bounds. Building on this, two quantitative metrics, including the Levelized
Cost of Security (LCoSec) and Cost of Incremental Security (CIS), are
formulated to unify capital, operational, and risk-related expenditures within
a discounted net-present-value framework. Using IEEE 118-bus, 123-node, and
39-bus test systems, we conduct discrete-event simulations comparing PQC-only,
QKD-only, and Hybrid architectures across multiple topologies and service
profiles. Results show that Hybrid architectures dominated by QKD significantly
reduce key-outage probability and SLA shortfalls, achieving near-unit
availability for real-time and confidentiality-critical services. Economic
analyses reveal clear breakeven zones where QKD-enhanced deployments become
cost-effective, primarily in metropolitan and distribution-level networks under
moderate optical loss and buffer sizing. The proposed framework provides a
reproducible, risk-aware decision tool for guiding large-scale, economically
justified QKD adoption in future resilient power-system infrastructures.

    <title>On Post-Quantum Cryptography Authentication for Quantum Key Distribution</title>
    <summary>  The traditional way for a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) user to join a
quantum network is by authenticating themselves using pre-shared key material.
While this approach is sufficient for small-scale networks, it becomes
impractical as the network grows, due to the total quadratic increase in the
number of pre-shared keys required. To address this scalability issue, Public
Key Infrastructure (PKI) combined with Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) offers a
more scalable solution, allowing users to authenticate the QKD traffic remotely
to obtain information-theoretical secure (ITS) keys under the presented
assumptions. Unlike traditional PKI, which relies on classical cryptographic
algorithms such as RSA, the approach presented in this paper leverages PQC
algorithms that are believed to be resistant to quantum attacks. Similarly to
the SIGMA or TLS protocols, authentication, confidentiality, and integrity are
achievable against bounded adversaries to ensure secure and scalable quantum
networks.

    <title>SALSA PICANTE: a machine learning attack on LWE with binary secrets</title>
    <summary>  Learning with Errors (LWE) is a hard math problem underpinning many proposed
post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) systems. The only PQC Key Exchange Mechanism
(KEM) standardized by NIST is based on module~LWE, and current publicly
available PQ Homomorphic Encryption (HE) libraries are based on ring LWE. The
security of LWE-based PQ cryptosystems is critical, but certain implementation
choices could weaken them. One such choice is sparse binary secrets, desirable
for PQ HE schemes for efficiency reasons. Prior work, SALSA, demonstrated a
machine learning-based attack on LWE with sparse binary secrets in small
dimensions ($n \le 128$) and low Hamming weights ($h \le 4$). However, this
attack assumes access to millions of eavesdropped LWE samples and fails at
higher Hamming weights or dimensions.
  We present PICANTE, an enhanced machine learning attack on LWE with sparse
binary secrets, which recovers secrets in much larger dimensions (up to
$n=350$) and with larger Hamming weights (roughly $n/10$, and up to $h=60$ for
$n=350$). We achieve this dramatic improvement via a novel preprocessing step,
which allows us to generate training data from a linear number of eavesdropped
LWE samples ($4n$) and changes the distribution of the data to improve
transformer training. We also improve the secret recovery methods of SALSA and
introduce a novel cross-attention recovery mechanism allowing us to read off
the secret directly from the trained models. While PICANTE does not threaten
NIST's proposed LWE standards, it demonstrates significant improvement over
SALSA and could scale further, highlighting the need for future investigation
into machine learning attacks on LWE with sparse binary secrets.

    <title>CCA-Secure Hybrid Encryption in Correlated Randomness Model and KEM
  Combiners</title>
    <summary>  A hybrid encryption (HE) system is an efficient public key encryption system
for arbitrarily long messages. An HE system consists of a public key component
called key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), and a symmetric key component called
data encapsulation mechanism (DEM). The HE encryption algorithm uses a KEM
generated key k to encapsulate the message using DEM, and send the ciphertext
together with the encapsulaton of k, to the decryptor who decapsulates k and
uses it to decapsulate the message using the corresponding KEM and DEM
components. The KEM/DEM composition theorem proves that if KEM and DEM satisfy
well-defined security notions, then HE will be secure with well defined
security. We introduce HE in correlated randomness model where the encryption
and decryption algorithms have samples of correlated random variables that are
partially leaked to the adversary. Security of the new KEM/DEM paradigm is
defined against computationally unbounded or polynomially bounded adversaries.
We define iKEM and cKEM with respective information theoretic computational
security, and prove a composition theorem for them and a computationally secure
DEM, resulting in secure HEs with proved computational security (CPA and CCA)
and without any computational assumption. We construct two iKEMs that provably
satisfy the required security notions of the composition theorem. The iKEMs are
used to construct two efficient quantum-resistant HEs when used with an AES
based DEM. We also define and construct combiners with proved security that
combine the new KEM/DEM paradigm of HE with the traditional public key based
paradigm of HE.

    <title>Hybrid Classical-Quantum Autoencoder for Anomaly Detection</title>
    <summary>  We propose a Hybrid classical-quantum Autoencoder (HAE) model, which is a
synergy of a classical autoencoder (AE) and a parametrized quantum circuit
(PQC) that is inserted into its bottleneck. The PQC augments the latent space,
on which a standard outlier detection method is applied to search for anomalous
data points within a classical dataset. Using this model and applying it to
both standard benchmarking datasets, and a specific use-case dataset which
relates to predictive maintenance of gas power plants, we show that the
addition of the PQC leads to a performance enhancement in terms of precision,
recall, and F1 score. Furthermore, we probe different PQC Ans\"atze and analyse
which PQC features make them effective for this task.

    <title>Software-Defined Cryptography: A Design Feature of Cryptographic Agility</title>
    <summary>  Given the widespread use of cryptography in Enterprise IT, migration to
post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is not drop-in replacement at all.
Cryptographic agility, or crypto-agility, is a design feature that enables
seamless updates to new cryptographic algorithms and standards without the need
to modify or replace the surrounding infrastructure. This paper introduces a
notion of software-defined cryptography as the desired design feature for
crypto-agility, emphasizing the role of software in providing centralized
governance for cryptography and automated enforcement of cryptographic
policies, such as migration to PQC.

    <title>Parameterized Quantum Circuits with Quantum Kernels for Machine
  Learning: A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Approach</title>
    <summary>  Quantum machine learning (QML) is the use of quantum computing for the
computation of machine learning algorithms. With the prevalence and importance
of classical data, a hybrid quantum-classical approach to QML is called for.
Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs), and particularly Quantum Kernel PQCs,
are generally used in the hybrid approach to QML. In this paper we discuss some
important aspects of PQCs with quantum kernels including PQCs, quantum kernels,
quantum kernels with quantum advantage, and the trainability of quantum
kernels. We conclude that quantum kernels with hybrid kernel methods, a.k.a.
quantum kernel methods, offer distinct advantages as a hybrid approach to QML.
Not only do they apply to Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, but
they also can be used to solve all types of machine learning problems including
regression, classification, clustering, and dimension reduction. Furthermore,
beyond quantum utility, quantum advantage can be attained if the quantum
kernels, i.e., the quantum feature encodings, are classically intractable.

    <title>Obfuscated Quantum and Post-Quantum Cryptography</title>
    <summary>  In this work, we present an experimental deployment of a new design for
combined quantum key distribution (QKD) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC).
Novel to our system is the dynamic obfuscation of the QKD-PQC sequence of
operations, the number of operations, and parameters related to the operations;
coupled to the integration of a GPS-free quantum synchronization protocol
within the QKD process. We compare the performance and overhead of our QKD-PQC
system relative to a standard QKD system with one-time pad encryption,
demonstrating that our design can operate in real time with little additional
overhead caused by the new security features. Since our system can offer
additional defensive strategies against a wide spectrum of practical attacks
that undermine deployed QKD, PQC, and certain combinations of these two
primitives, we suggest that our design represents one of the most secure
communication systems currently available. Given the dynamic nature of its
obfuscation attributes, our new system can also be adapted in the field to
defeat yet-to-be-discovered practical attacks.

    <title>Encoding-dependent generalization bounds for parametrized quantum
  circuits</title>
    <summary>  A large body of recent work has begun to explore the potential of
parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) as machine learning models, within the
framework of hybrid quantum-classical optimization. In particular, theoretical
guarantees on the out-of-sample performance of such models, in terms of
generalization bounds, have emerged. However, none of these generalization
bounds depend explicitly on how the classical input data is encoded into the
PQC. We derive generalization bounds for PQC-based models that depend
explicitly on the strategy used for data-encoding. These imply bounds on the
performance of trained PQC-based models on unseen data. Moreover, our results
facilitate the selection of optimal data-encoding strategies via structural
risk minimization, a mathematically rigorous framework for model selection. We
obtain our generalization bounds by bounding the complexity of PQC-based models
as measured by the Rademacher complexity and the metric entropy, two complexity
measures from statistical learning theory. To achieve this, we rely on a
representation of PQC-based models via trigonometric functions. Our
generalization bounds emphasize the importance of well-considered data-encoding
strategies for PQC-based models.

    <title>Mobile Energy Requirements of the Upcoming NIST Post-Quantum
  Cryptography Standards</title>
    <summary>  Standardization of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) was started by NIST in
2016 and has proceeded to its second elimination round. The upcoming standards
are intended to replace (or supplement) current RSA and Elliptic Curve
Cryptography (ECC) on all targets, including lightweight, embedded, and mobile
systems. We present an energy requirement analysis based on extensive
measurements of PQC candidate algorithms on a Cortex M4 - based reference
platform. We relate computational (energy) costs of PQC algorithms to their
data transmission costs which are expected to increase with new types of public
keys and ciphertext messages. The energy, bandwidth, and latency needs of PQC
algorithms span several orders of magnitude, which is substantial enough to
impact battery life, user experience, and application protocol design. We
propose metrics and guidelines for PQC algorithm usage in IoT and mobile
systems based on our findings. Our evidence supports the view that fast
structured-lattice PQC schemes are the preferred choice for cloud-connected
mobile devices in most use cases, even when per-bit data transmission energy
cost is relatively high.

    <title>Dimensional Expressivity Analysis, best-approximation errors, and
  automated design of parametric quantum circuits</title>
    <summary>  The design of parametric quantum circuits (PQCs) for efficient use in
variational quantum simulations (VQS) is subject to two competing factors. On
one hand, the set of states that can be generated by the PQC has to be large
enough to contain the solution state. Otherwise, one may at best find the best
approximation of the solution restricted to the states generated by the chosen
PQC. On the other hand, the PQC should contain as few parametric quantum gates
as possible to minimize noise from the quantum device. Thus, when designing a
PQC one needs to ensure that there are no redundant parameters. The dimensional
expressivity analysis discussed in these proceedings is a means of addressing
these counteracting effects. Its main objective is to identify independent and
redundant parameters in the PQC. Using this information, superfluous parameters
can be removed and the dimension of the space of states that are generated by
the PQC can be computed. Knowing the dimension of the physical state space then
allows us to deduce whether or not the PQC can reach all physical states.
Furthermore, the dimensional expressivity analysis can be implemented
efficiently using a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm. This implementation has
relatively small overhead costs both for the classical and quantum part of the
algorithm and could therefore be used in the future for on-the-fly circuit
construction. This would allow for optimized circuits to be used in every loop
of a VQS rather than the same PQC for the entire VQS. These proceedings review
and extend work in [1, 2].

    <title>Analysis of error dependencies on NewHope</title>
    <summary>  Among many submissions to the NIST post-quantum cryptography (PQC) project,
NewHope is a promising key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) based on the
Ring-Learning with errors (Ring-LWE) problem. Since NewHope is an
indistinguishability (IND)-chosen ciphertext attack secure KEM by applying the
Fujisaki-Okamoto transform to an IND-chosen plaintext attack secure public key
encryption, accurate calculation of decryption failure rate (DFR) is required
to guarantee resilience against attacks that exploit decryption failures.
However, the current upper bound of DFR on NewHope is rather loose because the
compression noise, the effect of encoding/decoding of NewHope, and the
approximation effect of centered binomial distribution are not fully
considered. Furthermore, since NewHope is a Ring-LWE based cryptosystem, there
is a problem of error dependency among error coefficients, which makes accurate
DFR calculation difficult. In this paper, we derive much tighter upper bound on
DFR than the current upper bound using constraint relaxation and union bound.
Especially, the above-mentioned factors are all considered in derivation of new
upper bound and the centered binomial distribution is not approximated to
subgaussian distribution. In addition, since the error dependency is
considered, the new upper bound is much closer to the real DFR than the
previous upper bound. Furthermore, the new upper bound is parameterized by
using Chernoff-Cramer bound in order to facilitate calculation of new upper
bound for the parameters of NewHope. Since the new upper bound is much lower
than the DFR requirement of PQC, this DFR margin is used to improve the
security and bandwidth efficiency of NewHope. As a result, the security level
of NewHope is improved by 7.2 % or bandwidth efficiency is improved by 5.9 %.

    <title>PMMP -- PQC Migration Management Process</title>
    <summary>  Organizations have to plan on migrating to quantum-resilient cryptographic
measures, also known as PQC. However, this is a difficult task, and to the best
of our knowledge, there is no generalized approach to manage such a complex
migration for cryptography used in IT systems that explicitly integrates into
organizations' steering mechanisms and control systems. We present PMMP, a
risk-based process for managing the migration of organizations from classic
cryptography to PQC and establishing crypto-agility. Having completed the
initial design phase, as well as a theoretical evaluation, we now intend to
promote PMMP. Practitioners are encouraged to join the effort in order to
enable a comprehensive practical evaluation and further development.

    <title>Q-RAN: Quantum-Resilient O-RAN Architecture</title>
    <summary>  The telecommunications industry faces a dual transformation: the
architectural shift toward Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) and the emerging
threat from quantum computing. O-RAN disaggregated, multi-vendor architecture
creates a larger attack surface vulnerable to crypt-analytically relevant
quantum computers(CRQCs) that will break current public key cryptography. The
Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (HNDL) attack strategy makes this threat immediate,
as adversaries can intercept encrypted data today for future decryption. This
paper presents Q-RAN, a comprehensive quantum-resistant security framework for
O-RAN networks using NIST-standardized Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). We
detail the implementation of ML-KEM (FIPS 203) and ML-DSA (FIPS 204),
integrated with Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNG) for cryptographic
entropy. The solution deploys PQ-IPsec, PQ-DTLS, and PQ-mTLS protocols across
all O-RAN interfaces, anchored by a centralized Post-Quantum Certificate
Authority (PQ-CA) within the SMO framework. This work provides a complete
roadmap for securing disaggregated O-RAN ecosystems against quantum
adversaries.

    <title>QuantumShield: Multilayer Fortification for Quantum Federated Learning</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we propose a groundbreaking quantum-secure federated learning
(QFL) framework designed to safeguard distributed learning systems against the
emerging threat of quantum-enabled adversaries. As classical cryptographic
methods become increasingly vulnerable to quantum attacks, our framework
establishes a resilient security architecture that remains robust even in the
presence of quantum-capable attackers. We integrate and rigorously evaluate
advanced quantum and post-quantum protocols including Quantum Key Distribution
(QKD), Quantum Teleportation, Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEM) and
Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) to fortify the QFL process against both
classical and quantum threats. These mechanisms are systematically analyzed and
implemented to demonstrate their seamless interoperability within a secure and
scalable QFL ecosystem. Through comprehensive theoretical modeling and
experimental validation, this work provides a detailed security and performance
assessment of the proposed framework. Our findings lay a strong foundation for
next-generation federated learning systems that are inherently secure in the
quantum era.

i.e., a tag, is known as tag-KEM, while a scheme that combines signature and
encryption is called signcryption. In this paper, we present a code-based
signcryption tag-KEM scheme. We utilize a code-based signature and an IND-CCA2
(adaptive chosen ciphertext attack) secure version of McEliece's encryption
scheme. The proposed scheme uses an equivalent subcode as a public code for the
receiver, making the NPcompleteness of the subcode equivalence problem to be
one of our main security assumptions. We then base the signcryption tag-KEM to
design a code-based hybrid signcryption scheme. A hybrid scheme deploys
asymmetric- as well as symmetric-key encryption. We give security analyses of
both our schemes in the standard model and prove that they are secure against
IND-CCA2 (indistinguishability under adaptive chosen ciphertext attack) and
SUF-CMA (strong existential unforgeability under chosen message attack).

    <title>Complexity of Post-Quantum Cryptography in Embedded Systems and Its
  Optimization Strategies</title>
    <summary>  With the rapid advancements in quantum computing, traditional cryptographic
schemes like Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)
are becoming vulnerable, necessitating the development of quantum-resistant
algorithms. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has
initiated a standardization process for PQC algorithms, and several candidates,
including CRYSTALS-Kyber and McEliece, have reached the final stages. This
paper first provides a comprehensive analysis of the hardware complexity of
post-quantum cryptography (PQC) in embedded systems, categorizing PQC
algorithms into families based on their underlying mathematical problems:
lattice-based, code-based, hash-based and multivariate / isogeny-based schemes.
Each family presents distinct computational, memory, and energy profiles,
making them suitable for different use cases. To address these challenges, this
paper discusses optimization strategies such as pipelining, parallelization,
and high-level synthesis (HLS), which can improve the performance and energy
efficiency of PQC implementations. Finally, a detailed complexity analysis of
CRYSTALS-Kyber and McEliece, comparing their key generation, encryption, and
decryption processes in terms of computational complexity, has been conducted.

    <title>An Evaluation of the State-of-the-Art Software and Hardware
  Implementations of BIKE</title>
    <summary>  NIST is conducting a process for the standardization of post-quantum
cryptosystems, i.e., cryptosystems that are resistant to attacks by both
traditional and quantum computers and that can thus substitute the traditional
public-key cryptography solutions which are expected to be broken by quantum
computers in the next decades. This manuscript provides an overview and a
comparison of the existing state-of-the-art implementations of the BIKE QC-MDPC
code-based post-quantum KEM, a candidate in NIST's PQC standardization process.
We consider both software, hardware, and mixed hardware-software
implementations and evaluate their performance and, for hardware ones, their
resource utilization.

    <title>Carry Your Fault: A Fault Propagation Attack on Side-Channel Protected
  LWE-based KEM</title>
    <summary>  Post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms, especially those based on the
learning with errors (LWE) problem, have been subjected to several physical
attacks in the recent past. Although the attacks broadly belong to two classes
- passive side-channel attacks and active fault attacks, the attack strategies
vary significantly due to the inherent complexities of such algorithms.
Exploring further attack surfaces is, therefore, an important step for
eventually securing the deployment of these algorithms. Also, it is important
to test the robustness of the already proposed countermeasures in this regard.
In this work, we propose a new fault attack on side-channel secure masked
implementation of LWE-based key-encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) exploiting
fault propagation. The attack typically originates due to an algorithmic
modification widely used to enable masking, namely the Arithmetic-to-Boolean
(A2B) conversion. We exploit the data dependency of the adder carry chain in
A2B and extract sensitive information, albeit masking (of arbitrary order)
being present. As a practical demonstration of the exploitability of this
information leakage, we show key recovery attacks of Kyber, although the
leakage also exists for other schemes like Saber. The attack on Kyber targets
the decapsulation module and utilizes Belief Propagation (BP) for key recovery.
To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attack exploiting an algorithmic
component introduced to ease masking rather than only exploiting the randomness
introduced by masking to obtain desired faults (as done by Delvaux). Finally,
we performed both simulated and electromagnetic (EM) fault-based practical
validation of the attack for an open-source first-order secure Kyber
implementation running on an STM32 platform.

    <title>Linking QKD testbeds across Europe</title>
    <summary>  Quantum-key-distribution (QKD) networks are gaining importance and it has
become necessary to analyze the most appropriate methods for their
long-distance interconnection. In this paper, four different methods of
interconnecting remote QKD networks are proposed. The methods are used to link
three different QKD testbeds in Europe, located in Berlin, Madrid, and Poznan.
Although long-distance QKD links are only emulated, the used methods can serve
as a blueprint for a secure interconnection of distant QKD networks in the
future. Specifically, the presented approaches combine, in a transparent way,
different fiber and satellite physical media, as well as common standards of
key-delivery interfaces. The testbed interconnections are designed to increase
the security by utilizing multipath techniques and multiple hybridizations of
QKD and post quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms.

    <title>Towards efficient and secure quantum-classical communication networks</title>
    <summary>  The rapid advancement of quantum technologies calls for the design and
deployment of quantum-safe cryptographic protocols and communication networks.
There are two primary approaches to achieving quantum-resistant security:
quantum key distribution (QKD) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC). While each
offers unique advantages, both have drawbacks in practical implementation. In
this work, we introduce the pros and cons of these protocols and explore how
they can be combined to achieve a higher level of security and/or improved
performance in key distribution. We hope our discussion inspires further
research into the design of hybrid cryptographic protocols for
quantum-classical communication networks.

    <title>A Survey of Post-Quantum Cryptography Support in Cryptographic Libraries</title>
    <summary>  The rapid advancement of quantum computing poses a significant threat to
modern cryptographic systems, necessitating the transition to Post-Quantum
Cryptography (PQC). This study evaluates the support for PQC algorithms within
nine widely used open-source cryptographic libraries -- OpenSSL, wolfSSL,
BoringSSL, LibreSSL, Bouncy Castle, libsodium, Crypto++, Botan, and MbedTLS --
focusing on their implementation of the NIST-selected PQC finalists:
CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, FALCON, and SPHINCS+. Our analysis, based
on the latest available documentation, release notes, and industry reports as
of early 2025, reveals a varied state of readiness across these libraries.
While some libraries have integrated PQC support or have clear implementation
roadmaps, others lag behind, creating potential security risks as quantum
threats become more imminent. We discuss key challenges, including performance
trade-offs, implementation security, and adoption hurdles in real-world
cryptographic applications. Our findings highlight the urgent need for
continued research, standardization efforts, and coordinated adoption
strategies to ensure a secure transition to the quantum-resistant cryptographic
landscape.

    <title>QKD Oracles for Authenticated Key Exchange</title>
    <summary>  Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) establishes shared ('symmetric')
cryptographic keys which are essential for secure online communication. AKE
protocols can be constructed from public-key cryptography like Key
Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs). Another approach is to use Quantum Key
Distribution (QKD) to establish a symmetric key, which uses quantum
communication. Combining post-quantum AKE and QKD appropriately may provide
security against quantum attacks even if only one of the two approaches turns
out to be secure.
  We provide an extensive review of existing security analyses for combined AKE
and their formal security models, and identify some gaps in their treatment of
QKD key IDs. In particular, improper handling of QKD key IDs leads to
Dependent-Key attacks on AKE.
  As our main conceptual contribution, we model QKD as an oracle that closely
resembles the standard ETSI 014 QKD interface. We demonstrate the usability of
our QKD oracle for cryptographic security analyses by integrating it into a
prominent security model for AKE, called CK+ model, thereby obtaining a
security model for combined AKE that catches Dependent-Key attacks. In this
model, we formally prove security of a new protocol that combines QKD with a
triple-KEM handshake. This is the first provably secure hybrid protocol that
maintains information-theoretic security of QKD.

    <title>AmphiKey: A Dual-Mode Secure Authenticated Key Encapsulation Protocol
  for Smart Grid</title>
    <summary>  AmphiKey, a dual-mode post-quantum/traditional (PQ/T) hybrid authenticated
key exchange mechanism (AKEM) has been designed to secure smart grid
communications against both classical and quantum threats. AmphiKey offers two
distinct operational modes within a single framework: an Authenticated Mode and
a Deniable Mode. The Authenticated Mode employs a blackbox approach, combining
ephemeral ML-KEM-768 and X25519 with long-term Raccoon DSA keys to provide
forward secrecy and strong, non-repudiable authenticity. This design achieves
"OR" confidentiality, where security holds if either of the KEMs is unbroken,
and robust "AND" authenticity. For the signature operation, it leverages the
'masking-friendly' Raccoon digital signature (DSA), which is specifically
designed for side-channel attack resistance, though this protection is
localized to the signing key and does not provide deniability. In contrast,
Deniable Mode provides deniable authentication, preserving privacy. The
protocol used ML-KEM-768 (AKEM-1), Ephemeral X25519 (AKEM-2), Raccoon-based DSA
(Rac) (compared performance to ML-DSA-65), and the Ascon cipher to deliver its
security guarantees. Key contributions include providing a flexible protocol
with enhanced security, optional deniability, and efficiency adapted to the
diverse needs of the smart grid infrastructure. We present a comprehensive
performance evaluation on a heterogeneous testbed featuring a powerful server
and client (AMD Ryzen 5) and a resource-constrained client (Raspberry Pi). In
efficient Deniable mode, the full handshake completes in 0.15 ms on the server
and 0.41 ms on the Raspberry Pi client. In contrast, the Authenticated Mode is
bottlenecked by the client-side signature generation; the handshake takes 4.8
ms for the Raspberry Pi client to initiate and 0.84 ms for the server to
verify.

    <title>Algorithmic Security is Insufficient: A Comprehensive Survey on
  Implementation Attacks Haunting Post-Quantum Security</title>
    <summary>  This survey is on forward-looking, emerging security concerns in post-quantum
era, i.e., the implementation attacks for 2022 winners of NIST post-quantum
cryptography (PQC) competition and thus the visions, insights, and discussions
can be used as a step forward towards scrutinizing the new standards for
applications ranging from Metaverse, Web 3.0 to deeply-embedded systems. The
rapid advances in quantum computing have brought immense opportunities for
scientific discovery and technological progress; however, it poses a major risk
to today's security since advanced quantum computers are believed to break all
traditional public-key cryptographic algorithms. This has led to active
research on PQC algorithms that are believed to be secure against classical and
powerful quantum computers. However, algorithmic security is unfortunately
insufficient, and many cryptographic algorithms are vulnerable to side-channel
attacks (SCA), where an attacker passively or actively gets side-channel data
to compromise the security properties that are assumed to be safe
theoretically. In this survey, we explore such imminent threats and their
countermeasures with respect to PQC. We provide the respective, latest
advancements in PQC research, as well as assessments and providing visions on
the different types of SCAs.

    <title>PLS-Assisted Offloading for Edge Computing-Enabled Post-Quantum Security
  in Resource-Constrained Devices</title>
    <summary>  With the advent of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standards, it has become
imperative for resource-constrained devices (RCDs) in the Internet of Things
(IoT) to adopt these quantum-resistant protocols. However, the high
computational overhead and the large key sizes associated with PQC make direct
deployment on such devices impractical. To address this challenge, we propose
an edge computing-enabled PQC framework that leverages a physical-layer
security (PLS)-assisted offloading strategy, allowing devices to either offload
intensive cryptographic tasks to a post-quantum edge server (PQES) or perform
them locally. Furthermore, to ensure data confidentiality within the edge
domain, our framework integrates two PLS techniques: offloading RCDs employ
wiretap coding to secure data transmission, while non-offloading RCDs serve as
friendly jammers by broadcasting artificial noise to disrupt potential
eavesdroppers. Accordingly, we co-design the computation offloading and PLS
strategy by jointly optimizing the device transmit power, PQES computation
resource allocation, and offloading decisions to minimize overall latency under
resource constraints. Numerical results demonstrate significant latency
reductions compared to baseline schemes, confirming the scalability and
efficiency of our approach for secure PQC operations in IoT networks.

    <title>Neural Predictor based Quantum Architecture Search</title>
    <summary>  Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are widely speculated to deliver
quantum advantages for practical problems under the quantum-classical hybrid
computational paradigm in the near term. Both theoretical and practical
developments of VQAs share many similarities with those of deep learning. For
instance, a key component of VQAs is the design of task-dependent parameterized
quantum circuits (PQCs) as in the case of designing a good neural architecture
in deep learning. Partly inspired by the recent success of AutoML and neural
architecture search (NAS), quantum architecture search (QAS) is a collection of
methods devised to engineer an optimal task-specific PQC. It has been proven
that QAS-designed VQAs can outperform expert-crafted VQAs under various
scenarios. In this work, we propose to use a neural network based predictor as
the evaluation policy for QAS. We demonstrate a neural predictor guided QAS can
discover powerful PQCs, yielding state-of-the-art results for various examples
from quantum simulation and quantum machine learning. Notably, neural predictor
guided QAS provides a better solution than that by the random-search baseline
while using an order of magnitude less of circuit evaluations. Moreover, the
predictor for QAS as well as the optimal ansatz found by QAS can both be
transferred and generalized to address similar problems.

    <title>The Expressive Power of Parameterized Quantum Circuits</title>
    <summary>  Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have been broadly used as a hybrid
quantum-classical machine learning scheme to accomplish generative tasks.
However, whether PQCs have better expressive power than classical generative
neural networks, such as restricted or deep Boltzmann machines, remains an open
issue. In this paper, we prove that PQCs with a simple structure already
outperform any classical neural network for generative tasks, unless the
polynomial hierarchy collapses. Our proof builds on known results from tensor
networks and quantum circuits (in particular, instantaneous quantum polynomial
circuits). In addition, PQCs equipped with ancillary qubits for post-selection
have even stronger expressive power than those without post-selection. We
employ them as an application for Bayesian learning, since it is possible to
learn prior probabilities rather than assuming they are known. We expect that
it will find many more applications in semi-supervised learning where prior
distributions are normally assumed to be unknown. Lastly, we conduct several
numerical experiments using the Rigetti Forest platform to demonstrate the
performance of the proposed Bayesian quantum circuit.

    <title>Matrix Product State Pre-Training for Quantum Machine Learning</title>
    <summary>  Hybrid Quantum-Classical algorithms are a promising candidate for developing
uses for NISQ devices. In particular, Parametrised Quantum Circuits (PQCs)
paired with classical optimizers have been used as a basis for quantum
chemistry and quantum optimization problems. Training PQCs relies on methods to
overcome the fact that the gradients of PQCs vanish exponentially in the size
of the circuits used. Tensor network methods are being increasingly used as a
classical machine learning tool, as well as a tool for studying quantum
systems. We introduce a circuit pre-training method based on matrix product
state machine learning methods, and demonstrate that it accelerates training of
PQCs for both supervised learning, energy minimization, and combinatorial
optimization.

    <title>Assessing and Enhancing Quantum Readiness in Mobile Apps</title>
    <summary>  Quantum computers threaten widely deployed cryptographic primitives such as
RSA, DSA, and ECC. While NIST has released post-quantum cryptographic (PQC)
standards (e.g., Kyber, Dilithium), mobile app ecosystems remain largely
unprepared for this transition. We present a large-scale binary analysis of
over 4,000 Android apps to assess cryptographic readiness. Our results show
widespread reliance on quantum-vulnerable algorithms such as MD5, SHA-1, and
RSA, while PQC adoption remains absent in production apps. To bridge the
readiness gap, we explore LLM-assisted migration. We evaluate leading LLMs
(GPT-4o, Gemini Flash, Claude Sonnet, etc.) for automated cryptographic
migration. All models successfully performed simple hash replacements (e.g.,
SHA-1 to SHA-256). However, none produced correct PQC upgrades due to
multi-file changes, missing imports, and lack of context awareness. These
results underscore the need for structured guidance and system-aware tooling
for post-quantum migration

    <title>PQ-CAN: A Framework for Simulating Post-Quantum Cryptography in Embedded
  Systems</title>
    <summary>  The rapid development of quantum computers threatens traditional
cryptographic schemes, prompting the need for Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC).
Although the NIST standardization process has accelerated the development of
such algorithms, their application in resource-constrained environments such as
embedded systems remains a challenge. Automotive systems relying on the
Controller Area Network (CAN) bus for communication are particularly vulnerable
due to their limited computational capabilities, high traffic, and need for
real-time response. These constraints raise concerns about the feasibility of
implementing PQC in automotive environments, where legacy hardware and bit rate
limitations must also be considered.
  In this paper, we introduce PQ-CAN, a modular framework for simulating the
performance and overhead of PQC algorithms in embedded systems. We consider the
automotive domain as our case study, testing a variety of PQC schemes under
different scenarios. Our simulation enables the adjustment of embedded system
computational capabilities and CAN bus bit rate constraints. We also provide
insights into the trade-offs involved by analyzing each algorithm's security
level and overhead for key encapsulation and digital signature. By evaluating
the performance of these algorithms, we provide insights into their feasibility
and identify the strengths and limitations of PQC in securing automotive
communications in the post-quantum era.

    <title>HQCC: A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Classifier with Adaptive Structure</title>
    <summary>  Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) with fixed structures severely degrade
the performance of Quantum Machine Learning (QML). To address this, a Hybrid
Quantum-Classical Classifier (HQCC) is proposed. It opens a practical way to
advance QML in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era by adaptively
optimizing the PQC through a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) driven dynamic
circuit generator, utilizing a local quantum filter for scalable feature
extraction, and exploiting architectural plasticity to balance the entanglement
depth and noise robustness. We realize the HQCC on the TensorCircuit platform
and run simulations on the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, achieving up to
97.12\% accuracy on MNIST and outperforming several alternative methods.

    <title>Zur Integration von Post-Quantum Verfahren in bestehende
  Softwareprodukte</title>
    <summary>  Currently, PQC algorithms are being standardized to address the emerging
threat to conventional asymmetric algorithms from quantum computing. These new
algorithms must then be integrated into existing protocols, applications and
infrastructures. Integration problems are to be expected, due to
incompatibilities with existing standards and implementations on the one hand,
but also due to a lack of knowledge among software developers about how to
handle PQC algorithms. To illustrate incompatibilities, we integrate two
different PQC algorithms into two different existing software products (the
InboxPager email client for the Android OS and the TLS implementation of the
Bouncy Castle crypto library). Here, we rely on the highly-abstract crypto
library eUCRITE, which hides technical details about the correct usage of
classical and PCQ algorithms and thus prevents some potential implementation
errors.

    <title>Quafu-RL: The Cloud Quantum Computers based Quantum Reinforcement
  Learning</title>
    <summary>  With the rapid advent of quantum computing, hybrid quantum-classical machine
learning has shown promising computational advantages in many key fields.
Quantum reinforcement learning, as one of the most challenging tasks, has
recently demonstrated its ability to solve standard benchmark environments with
formally provable theoretical advantages over classical counterparts. However,
despite the progress of quantum processors and the emergence of quantum
computing clouds in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, algorithms
based on parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are rarely conducted on NISQ
devices. In this work, we take the first step towards executing benchmark
quantum reinforcement problems on various real devices equipped with at most
136 qubits on BAQIS Quafu quantum computing cloud. The experimental results
demonstrate that the Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are capable of
achieving goals that are slightly relaxed both during the training and
inference stages. Moreover, we meticulously design hardware-efficient PQC
architectures in the quantum model using a multi-objective evolutionary
algorithm and develop a learning algorithm that is adaptable to Quafu. We hope
that the Quafu-RL be a guiding example to show how to realize machine learning
task by taking advantage of quantum computers on the quantum cloud platform.

    <title>Authentication of quantum key distribution with post-quantum
  cryptography and replay attacks</title>
    <summary>  With the development of quantum computers, traditional cryptographic systems
are facing more and more serious security threats. Fortunately, quantum key
distribution (QKD) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) are two cryptographic
mechanisms with quantum-resistant security, and both will become important
solutions for future information security. However, neither of them is perfect,
and they are complementary. Quantum key distribution has unconditional security
that post-quantum cryptography does not have, and PQC can provide secure and
convenient authentication for QKD networks. In this paper, we propose two
protocols based on PQC to realize the full authentication of the QKD data
post-processing, and we only need to assume the short-term security of PQC
algorithm to ensure the long-term quantum resistant security of distributed
keys. We found that for the above two authentication protocols, attackers
cannot successfully implement replay attacks. These authentication protocols
can solve the problems of the current pre-shared key authentication in the
application of large-scale quantum key distribution networks, and are expected
to realize a key distribution mechanism with practical operability and quantum
resistant security, which will be beneficial to promote the deployment and
application of quantum key distribution networks.

    <title>Parametrized Quantum Circuit Learning for Quantum Chemical Applications</title>
    <summary>  In the field of quantum machine learning (QML), parametrized quantum circuits
(PQCs) -- constructed using a combination of fixed and tunable quantum gates --
provide a promising hybrid framework for tackling complex machine learning
problems. Despite numerous proposed applications, there remains limited
exploration of datasets relevant to quantum chemistry. In this study, we
investigate the potential benefits and limitations of PQCs on two chemically
meaningful datasets: (1) the BSE49 dataset, containing bond separation energies
for 49 different classes of chemical bonds, and (2) a dataset of water
conformations, where coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) wavefunctions
are predicted from lower-level electronic structure methods using the
data-driven coupled-cluster (DDCC) approach. We construct a comprehensive set
of 168 PQCs by combining 14 data encoding strategies with 12 variational
ans{\"a}tze, and evaluate their performance on circuits with 5 and 16 qubits.
Our initial analysis examines the impact of circuit structure on model
performance using state-vector simulations. We then explore how circuit depth
and training set size influence model performance. Finally, we assess the
performance of the best-performing PQCs on current quantum hardware, using both
noisy simulations ("fake" backends) and real quantum devices. Our findings
underscore the challenges of applying PQCs to chemically relevant problems that
are straightforward for classical machine learning methods but remain
non-trivial for quantum approaches.

    <title>Solving Optimal Power Flow using a Variational Quantum Approach</title>
    <summary>  The optimal power flow (OPF) is a large-scale optimization problem that is
central in the operation of electric power systems. Although it can be posed as
a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program, the complexity of
modern-day power grids raises scalability and optimality challenges. In this
context, this work proposes a variational quantum paradigm for solving the OPF.
We encode primal variables through the state of a parameterized quantum circuit
(PQC), and dual variables through the probability mass function associated with
a second PQC. The Lagrangian function can thus be expressed as scaled
expectations of quantum observables. An OPF solution can be found by
minimizing/maximizing the Lagrangian over the parameters of the first/second
PQC. We pursue saddle points of the Lagrangian in a hybrid fashion. Gradients
of the Lagrangian are estimated using the two PQCs, while PQC parameters are
updated classically using a primal-dual method. We propose permuting primal
variables so that OPF observables are expressed in a banded form, allowing them
to be measured efficiently. Numerical tests on the IEEE 57-node power system
using Pennylane's simulator corroborate that the proposed doubly variational
quantum framework can find high-quality OPF solutions. Although showcased for
the OPF, this framework features a broader scope, including conic programs with
numerous variables and constraints, problems defined over sparse graphs, and
training quantum machine learning models to satisfy constraints.

    <title>Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Signatures Without Trapdoors</title>
    <summary>  Some of our current public key methods use a trap door to implement digital
signature methods. This includes the RSA method, which uses Fermat's little
theorem to support the creation and verification of a digital signature. The
problem with a back-door is that the actual trap-door method could, in the end,
be discovered. With the rise of PQC (Post Quantum Cryptography), we will see a
range of methods that will not use trap doors and provide stronger proof of
security. In this case, we use hash-based signatures (as used with SPHINCS+)
and Fiat Shamir signatures using Zero Knowledge Proofs (as used with
Dilithium).

    <title>Improving security and bandwidth efficiency of NewHope using
  error-correction schemes</title>
    <summary>  Among many submissions to the NIST post-quantum cryptography (PQC) project,
NewHope is a promising key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) based on the
Ring-Learning with errors (Ring-LWE) problem. Since the most important factors
to be considered for PQC are security and cost including bandwidth and
time/space complexity, in this paper, by doing exact noise analysis and using
Bose Chaudhuri Hocquenghem (BCH) codes, it is shown that the security and
bandwidth efficiency of NewHope can be substantially improved. In detail, the
decryption failure rate (DFR) of NewHope is recalculated by performing exact
noise analysis, and it is shown that the DFR of NewHope has been too
conservatively calculated. Since the recalculated DFR is much lower than the
required $2^{-128}$, this DFR margin is exploited to improve the security up to
8.5 \% or the bandwidth efficiency up to 5.9 \% without changing the procedure
of NewHope.
  The additive threshold encoding (ATE) used in NewHope is a simple error
correcting code (ECC) robust to side channel attack, but its error-correction
capability is relatively weak compared with other ECCs. Therefore, if a proper
error-correction scheme is applied to NewHope, either security or bandwidth
efficiency or both can be improved. Among various ECCs, BCH code has been
widely studied for its application to cryptosystems due to its advantages such
as no error floor problem. In this paper, the ATE and total noise channel are
regarded as a super channel from an information-theoretic viewpoint. Based on
this super channel analysis, various concatenated coding schemes of ATE and BCH
code for NewHope have been investigated. Through numerical analysis, it is
revealed that the security and bandwidth efficiency of NewHope are
substantially improved by using the proposed error-correction schemes.

    <title>Algebraic Extension Ring Framework for Non-Commutative Asymmetric
  Cryptography</title>
    <summary>  Post-Quantum Cryptography PQC attempts to find cryptographic protocols
resistant to attacks using Shors polynomial time algorithm for numerical field
problems or Grovers algorithm to find the unique input to a black-box function
that produces a particular output value. The use of non-standard algebraic
structures like non-commutative or non-associative structures, combined with
one-way trapdoor functions derived from combinatorial group theory, are mainly
unexplored choices for these new kinds of protocols and overlooked in current
PQC solutions. In this paper, we develop an algebraic extension ring framework
who could be applied to different asymmetric protocols, i.e. key exchange, key
transport, enciphering, digital signature, zero-knowledge authentication,
oblivious transfer, secret sharing etc.. A valuable feature is that there is no
need for big number libraries as all arithmetic is performed in F256 extension
field operations (precisely the AES field). We assume that the new framework is
cryptographical secure against strong classical attacks like the
sometimes-useful length-based attack, Romankovs linearization attacks and
Tsabans algebraic span attack. This statement is based on the non-linear
structure of the selected platform which proved to be useful protecting the AES
protocol. Otherwise, it could resist post-quantum attacks Grover, Shor and be
particularly useful for computational platforms with limited capabilities like
USB cryptographic keys or smartcards. Semantic security IND-CCA2 could also be
inferred for this new platform.

    <title>Hybrid Parameterized Quantum States for Variational Quantum Learning</title>
    <summary>  Variational quantum learning faces practical challenges in the noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. Parameterized quantum circuit (PQC)
models suffer from statistical uncertainty due to finite-shot measurements and
are highly sensitive to quantum noise, while purely classical approximations
like neural quantum states (NQS) lack access to genuine quantum correlations
and are limited in scalability. This work introduces Hybrid Parameterized
Quantum States (HPQS), a general-purpose modeling framework that interpolates
between quantum and classical parameterizations. HPQS combines PQC-based
measurements with neural estimators via a blending mechanism and postprocessing
functions, enabling enhanced, shot-efficient evaluation under hardware
constraints. We demonstrate HPQS across three representative quantum learning
tasks: (1) Expectation-based QML, where HPQS yields higher classification
accuracy than PQC-only and NQS-only baselines under limited quantum
measurements. (2) Quantum-Train, where HPQS generates the entire parameter set
of classical networks using polylogarithmic trainable variables; and (3)
Quantum Parameter Adaptation (QPA), where HPQS produces LoRA adapter parameters
for fine-tuning large language models like GPT-2 and Gemma-2 with improved
perplexity under low-shot conditions; Together, these results position HPQS as
a scalable, noise-resilient approach for variational quantum learning,
compatible with both current NISQ hardware and future fault-tolerant
architectures.

    <title>Exploring Post Quantum Cryptography with Quantum Key Distribution for
  Sustainable Mobile Network Architecture Design</title>
    <summary>  The proliferation of mobile networks and their increasing importance to
modern life, combined with the emerging threat of quantum computing, present
new challenges and opportunities for cybersecurity. This paper addresses the
complexity of protecting these critical infrastructures against future quantum
attacks while considering operational sustainability. We begin with an overview
of the current landscape, identify the main vulnerabilities in mobile networks,
and evaluate existing security solutions with new post-quantum cryptography
(PQC) methods. We then present a quantum-secure architecture with PQC and
Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) tailored explicitly for sustainable mobile
networks and illustrate its applicability with several use cases that emphasize
the need for advanced protection measures in this new era. In addition, a
comprehensive analysis of PQC algorithm families is presented, focusing on
their suitability for integration in mobile environments, with particular
attention to the trade-offs between energy consumption and security
improvements. Finally, recommendations for strengthening mobile networks
against quantum threats are provided through a detailed examination of current
challenges and opportunities.

    <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
    <summary>  We present a hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN)
architecture in which the entire recurrent core is realized as a parametrized
quantum circuit (PQC) controlled by a classical feedforward network. The hidden
state is the quantum state of an $n$-qubit PQC, residing in an exponentially
large Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$. The PQC is unitary by construction,
making the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints.
At each timestep, mid-circuit readouts are combined with the input embedding
and processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical
nonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state
via unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it
unifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial
observation via mid-circuit measurements, and (iii) nonlinear classical control
for input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with
up to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory,
and language modeling, adopting projective measurements as a limiting case to
obtain mid-circuit readouts while maintaining a coherent recurrent quantum
memory. We further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit
readouts in a sequence-to-sequence model and show its effectiveness for machine
translation. To our knowledge, this is the first model (RNN or otherwise)
grounded in quantum operations to achieve competitive performance against
strong classical baselines across a broad class of sequence-learning tasks.

    <title>PQC: Triple Decomposition Problem Applied To GL(d, Fp) - A Secure
  Framework For Canonical Non-Commutative Cryptography</title>
    <summary>  Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) attempts to find cryptographic protocols
resistant to attacks using Shor polynomial time algorithm for numerical field
problems or Grover search algorithm. A mostly overlooked but valuable line of
solutions is provided by non-commutative algebraic structures, specifically
canonical protocols that rely on one-way trapdoor functions (OWTF). Here we
develop an algebraic framework who could be applied to different asymmetric
protocols like D-H KE (Diffie-Hellman key exchange), Public Key Encryption,
Digital Signature, ZKP (zero-knowledge proof) authentication, Oblivious
Transfer, Multi-Party Computing, and so on. The trapdoor one-way functions
selected are (a) Triple decomposition Problem (TDP) developed by Kurt, where a
known element is factored into a product of three unknown factors and (b) a new
version of conjugacy search that we refer from now on as Blind Conjugacy Search
Problem (BCSP). Our platform structure is the general linear group GL(d,F_p)
d-square non-singular matrices of prime field values. We give support to the
fact that this framework is cryptographically secure against classical attacks
like linear algebra attacks, length-based attacks, side-channel attacks against
square (or duplicate) and multiply (or sum) algorithm, high sensitivity to
pseudo random deterministic generators, etc. At same time it is immune against
quantum attacks (using Grover and Shor), if the size parameters are carefully
selected. Semantic security and IND-CCA2 compliance for this framework is
discussed.

    <title>Information-theoretic Key Encapsulation and its Applications</title>
    <summary>  A hybrid encryption scheme is a public-key encryption system that consists of
a public-key part called the key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), and a
(symmetric) secret-key part called data encapsulation mechanism (DEM): the
public-key part is used to generate a shared secret key between two parties,
and the symmetric key part is used to encrypt the message using the generated
key. Hybrid encryption schemes are widely used for secure communication over
the Internet. In this paper, we initiate the study of hybrid encryption in
preprocessing model which assumes access to initial correlated variables by all
parties (including the eavesdropper). We define information-theoretic KEM
(iKEM) that, together with a (computationally) secure DEM, results in a hybrid
encryption scheme in preprocessing model. We define the security of each
building block, and prove a composition theorem that guarantees (computational)
qe-chosen plaintext (CPA) security of the hybrid encryption system if the iKEM
and the DEM satisfy qe-chosen encapculation attack and one-time security,
respectively. We show that iKEM can be realized by a one-way SKA (OW-SKA)
protocol with a revised security definition. Using an OW-SKA that satisfies
this revised definition of security effectively allows the secret key that is
generated by the OW-SKA to be used with a one-time symmetric key encryption
system such as XORing a pseudorandom string with the message, and provide
qe-CPA security for the hybrid encryption system.We discuss our results and
directions for future work.

    <title>KyberMat: Efficient Accelerator for Matrix-Vector Polynomial
  Multiplication in CRYSTALS-Kyber Scheme via NTT and Polyphase Decomposition</title>
    <summary>  CRYSTAL-Kyber (Kyber) is one of the post-quantum cryptography (PQC)
key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM) schemes selected during the standardization
process. This paper addresses optimization for Kyber architecture with respect
to latency and throughput constraints. Specifically, matrix-vector
multiplication and number theoretic transform (NTT)-based polynomial
multiplication are critical operations and bottlenecks that require
optimization. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithm and hardware
co-design approach to systematically optimize matrix-vector multiplication and
NTT-based polynomial multiplication by employing a novel sub-structure sharing
technique in order to reduce computational complexity, i.e., the number of
modular multiplications and modular additions/subtractions consumed. The
sub-structure sharing approach is inspired by prior fast parallel approaches
based on polyphase decomposition. The proposed efficient feed-forward
architecture achieves high speed, low latency, and full utilization of all
hardware components, which can significantly enhance the overall efficiency of
the Kyber scheme. The FPGA implementation results show that our proposed
design, using the fast two-parallel structure, leads to an approximate
reduction of 90% in execution time, along with a 66 times improvement in
throughput performance.

asymmetric cryptographic methods in the current Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
systems are gradually being threatened. Therefore, this study explores X.509
security certificates based on Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and discusses
implemented solutions. This study compares mainstream asymmetric cryptographic
methods (including RSA and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA))
with standard PQC methods (including Falcon, Dilithium, SPHINCS+), comparing
the efficiency of certificate generation, signature generation, and signature
verification. Finally, recommendations for a solution based on PQC for X.509
security certificates are proposed.

    <title>Implementing and Evaluating Post-Quantum DNSSEC in CoreDNS</title>
    <summary>  The emergence of quantum computers poses a significant threat to current
secure service, application and/or protocol implementations that rely on RSA
and ECDSA algorithms, for instance DNSSEC, because public-key cryptography
based on number factorization or discrete logarithm is vulnerable to quantum
attacks. This paper presents the integration of post-quantum cryptographic
(PQC) algorithms into CoreDNS to enable quantum-resistant DNSSEC functionality.
We have developed a plugin that extends CoreDNS with support for five PQC
signature algorithm families: ML-DSA, FALCON, SPHINCS+, MAYO, and SNOVA. Our
implementation maintains compatibility with existing DNS resolution flows while
providing on-the-fly signing using quantum-resistant signatures. A benchmark
has been performed and performance evaluation results reveal significant
trade-offs between security and efficiency. The results indicate that while PQC
algorithms introduce operational overhead, several candidates offer viable
compromises for transitioning DNSSEC to quantum-resistant cryptography.

    <title>AI-Driven Post-Quantum Cryptography for Cyber-Resilient V2X
  Communication in Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
    <summary>  Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems (TCPS) integrate physical elements,
such as transportation infrastructure and vehicles, with cyber elements via
advanced communication technologies, allowing them to interact seamlessly. This
integration enhances the efficiency, safety, and sustainability of
transportation systems. TCPS rely heavily on cryptographic security to protect
sensitive information transmitted between vehicles, transportation
infrastructure, and other entities within the transportation ecosystem,
ensuring data integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity. Traditional
cryptographic methods have been employed to secure TCPS communications, but the
advent of quantum computing presents a significant threat to these existing
security measures. Therefore, integrating Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) into
TCPS is essential to maintain secure and resilient communications. While PQC
offers a promising approach to developing cryptographic algorithms resistant to
quantum attacks, artificial intelligence (AI) can enhance PQC by optimizing
algorithm selection, resource allocation, and adapting to evolving threats in
real-time. AI-driven PQC approaches can improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of PQC implementations, ensuring robust security without
compromising system performance. This chapter introduces TCPS communication
protocols, discusses the vulnerabilities of corresponding communications to
cyber-attacks, and explores the limitations of existing cryptographic methods
in the quantum era. By examining how AI can strengthen PQC solutions, the
chapter presents cyber-resilient communication strategies for TCPS.

    <title>Enhancing Hybrid Methods in Parameterized Quantum Circuit Optimization</title>
    <summary>  Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) play an essential role in the
application of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) in noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. The PQCs are a leading candidate to
achieve a quantum advantage in NISQ devices and have already been applied in
various domains such as quantum chemistry, quantum machine learning,
combinatorial optimization, and many others. There is no single definitive way
to optimize PQCs. The most commonly used methods are based on computing the
gradient via the parameter-shift rule to use classical gradient descent (GD)
optimizers like Adam, stochastic GD, and others. In addition, sequential
single-qubit optimizers have been proposed, such as Rotosolve, Free-Axis
Selection (Fraxis), Free-Quaternion Selection (FQS), and hybrid algorithms from
the aforementioned optimizers. We further develop hybrid algorithms than those
represented in the previous work by drawing inspiration from the early stopping
method used in classical machine learning. The switch between the optimizers
depends on the previous cost function values compared to the previous ones. We
introduce two new hybrid algorithms that are more robust and scalable, and they
outperform previous hybrid methods in terms of convergence towards the global
minima across various cost functions. In addition, we find that they are
feasible for NISQ devices with different noise profiles.

    <title>Let Students Take the Wheel: Introducing Post-Quantum Cryptography with
  Active Learning</title>
    <summary>  Quantum computing presents a double-edged sword: while it has the potential
to revolutionize fields such as artificial intelligence, optimization,
healthcare, and so on, it simultaneously poses a threat to current
cryptographic systems, such as public-key encryption. To address this threat,
post-quantum cryptography (PQC) has been identified as the solution to secure
existing software systems, promoting a national initiative to prepare the next
generation with the necessary knowledge and skills. However, PQC is an emerging
interdisciplinary topic, presenting significant challenges for educators and
learners. This research proposes a novel active learning approach and assesses
the best practices for teaching PQC to undergraduate and graduate students in
the discipline of information systems.
  Our contributions are two-fold. First, we compare two instructional methods:
1) traditional faculty-led lectures and 2) student-led seminars, both
integrated with active learning techniques such as hands-on coding exercises
and Kahoot games. The effectiveness of these methods is evaluated through
student assessments and surveys. Second, we have published our lecture video,
slides, and findings so that other researchers and educators can reuse the
courseware and materials to develop their own PQC learning modules.
  We employ statistical analysis (e.g., t-test and chi-square test) to compare
the learning outcomes and students' feedback between the two learning methods
in each course. Our findings suggest that student-led seminars significantly
enhance learning outcomes, particularly for graduate students, where a notable
improvement in comprehension and engagement is observed. Moving forward, we aim
to scale these modules to diverse educational contexts and explore additional
active learning and experiential learning strategies for teaching complex
concepts of quantum information science.

    <title>Authentication Against Insecure Bootstrapping for 5G Networks:
  Feasibility, Resiliency, and Transitional Solutions in Post-Quantum Era</title>
    <summary>  The 5G protocol lacks a robust base station authentication mechanism during
the initial bootstrapping phase, leaving it susceptible to threats such as fake
base station attacks. Conventional solutions, including digital signatures
based on Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs) and identity-based signatures, are
inadequate against quantum-capable adversaries. While integrating NIST's
Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standards is a leading approach for quantum
resistance, their suitability for 5G base station authentication remains
unexplored. Moreover, current solutions are predominantly centralized and lack
security features such as distributed authentication. This work presents, to
our knowledge, the first comprehensive network-level performance
characterization of integrating NIST-PQC standards and conventional digital
signatures (including threshold and identity-based schemes) into 5G base
station authentication. Our findings reveal significant feasibility concerns,
with direct PQC adoption hindered by protocol constraints and large signature
sizes. We also highlight the performance limitations of conventional methods
due to the overhead of certificate chains. To mitigate these challenges, we
propose BORG, a transitional authentication solution based on a Hierarchical
Identity-Based Threshold Signature scheme with a Fail-Stop property. BORG
offers post-mortem post-quantum forgery detection and distributed trust via
threshold and compact signatures, well-suited for 5G's stringent requirements.
Our performance analysis underscores an important warning on the infeasibility
of direct PQC integration and positions BORG as an effective transitional
solution toward future quantum-resilient 5G authentication.

    <title>Mode connectivity in the loss landscape of parameterized quantum
  circuits</title>
    <summary>  Variational training of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) underpins many
workflows employed on near-term noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ)
devices. It is a hybrid quantum-classical approach that minimizes an associated
cost function in order to train a parameterized ansatz. In this paper we adapt
the qualitative loss landscape characterization for neural networks introduced
in \cite{goodfellow2014qualitatively,li2017visualizing} and tests for
connectivity used in \cite{draxler2018essentially} to study the loss landscape
features in PQC training. We present results for PQCs trained on a simple
regression task, using the bilayer circuit ansatz, which consists of
alternating layers of parameterized rotation gates and entangling gates.
Multiple circuits are trained with $3$ different batch gradient optimizers:
stochastic gradient descent, the quantum natural gradient, and Adam. We
identify large features in the landscape that can lead to faster convergence in
training workflows.

    <title>Efficient Quantum Feature Extraction for CNN-based Learning</title>
    <summary>  Recent work has begun to explore the potential of parametrized quantum
circuits (PQCs) as general function approximators. In this work, we propose a
quantum-classical deep network structure to enhance classical CNN model
discriminability. The convolutional layer uses linear filters to scan the input
data. Moreover, we build PQC, which is a more potent function approximator,
with more complex structures to capture the features within the receptive
field. The feature maps are obtained by sliding the PQCs over the input in a
similar way as CNN. We also give a training algorithm for the proposed model.
The hybrid models used in our design are validated by numerical simulation. We
demonstrate the reasonable classification performances on MNIST and we compare
the performances with models in different settings. The results disclose that
the model with ansatz in high expressibility achieves lower cost and higher
accuracy.

    <title>qLEET: Visualizing Loss Landscapes, Expressibility, Entangling Power and
  Training Trajectories for Parameterized Quantum Circuits</title>
    <summary>  We present qLEET, an open-source Python package for studying parameterized
quantum circuits (PQCs), which are widely used in various variational quantum
algorithms (VQAs) and quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms. qLEET enables
the computation of properties such as expressibility and entangling power of a
PQC by studying its entanglement spectrum and the distribution of parameterized
states produced by it. Furthermore, it allows users to visualize the training
trajectories of PQCs along with high-dimensional loss landscapes generated by
them for different objective functions. It supports quantum circuits and noise
models built using popular quantum computing libraries such as Qiskit, Cirq,
and Pyquil. In our work, we demonstrate how qLEET provides opportunities to
design and improve hybrid quantum-classical algorithms by utilizing intuitive
insights from the ansatz capability and structure of the loss landscape.
