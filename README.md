**Post-Quantum Cryptography Article Collector (2016‚Äì2025)**
The project enables reproducible research collection by combining APIs from arXiv, CrossRef, DBLP, IACR, Springer, and IEEE Xplore.
All requests are timestamped, logged, and the outputs are stored in structured formats (.json, .atom, .html).

**Key Features**

Automated Collection: Retrieves metadata and publication records for defined PQC-related keywords.

Multi-Source Coverage: Integrates results from open-access repositories, APIs, and HTML scraping where necessary.

Temporal Filtering: Supports collection of publications between 2016 and 2025, ensuring relevance to current and emerging research.

Traceability: Logs exact query URLs, timestamps, and request headers for reproducibility.

Structured Output: Saves results in machine-readable formats (.json, .atom, .html) for further analysis.

Scalable and Extensible: Optional API keys enable access to private sources (Springer, IEEE) for richer datasets.

**Scientific and Practical Utility**

Supports Research and Development: Provides curated datasets for PQC and hybrid key exchange studies, facilitating literature reviews, benchmarking, and trend analysis.

Enables Reproducibility: Ensures that queries, temporal ranges, and collection methods can be replicated, supporting rigorous academic research.

Informs Strategic Decisions: Helps organizations track emerging standards and key publications relevant to PQC migration and hybrid KEM implementation.

Facilitates Data Analysis: Results can be used for bibliometric studies, visualization of research trends, and identification of influential papers and authors.

**Objectives**

Systematic aggregation of research publications related to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC).

Analysis and comparison of publication trends across major academic repositories.

Export of metadata in structured, transparent, and machine-readable formats to facilitate further processing.

Reproducible data collection, ensuring that queries and temporal ranges can be consistently repeated for verification or longitudinal studies.

**Targeted Research Keywords**

The following key terms are automatically queried across all supported databases:

post-quantum cryptography

hybrid key exchange

PQC migration

hybrid KEM

TLS PQC

KEMTLS

**Collection Period**

The script collects publications between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2025 (inclusive).

**Requirements**

Python 3.8+
Required libraries:
pip install requests beautifulsoup4

Optional (for extended sources):

Environment variables for private APIs
export SPRINGER_API_KEY="your_springer_key"
export IEEE_API_KEY="your_ieee_key"

**Output Files**

All results are saved under the collect_pqc_output/ directory:

| **File**                | **Description**                                            |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `audit_log.txt`         | Contains detailed logs with timestamps and queried URLs.   |
| `arxiv_results.atom`    | Raw metadata retrieved directly from the arXiv API.        |
| `crossref_results.json` | Structured bibliographic metadata collected from CrossRef. |
| `dblp_results.json`     | Publication records extracted from the DBLP database.      |
| `iacr_search.html`      | Full HTML snapshot of the IACR search results page.        |

üîç Reproducibility

Each execution automatically logs the exact date and time of every query, records the full API endpoints used, and maintains consistent parameters and year ranges ensuring complete transparency and reproducibility of the data collection process.
